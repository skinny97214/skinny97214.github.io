Two months ago, I took the first step. I summoned all the wits I had and walked out into the streets of Brussels to find a stranger to have an interaction with. I found the bright-colored wall first. I determined to stand by this wall until someone interesting-looking came by, and then I would lure them into letting me take their photo. If you ever need a good plan sorted, just call me up. After a half dozen NOs, this man, Driss, agreed. His native language was Arabic and my flailing attempts at French were going nowhere. Finally we defaulted to English with better success. He asked the most simple question "What are you going to do with these photos?" I blinked a few times and replied, "I don't know."
