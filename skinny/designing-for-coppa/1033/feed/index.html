		<description><![CDATA[I almost never leave remarks, however i did a few searching and wound up here Designing for COPPA . And I do have 2 questions for you if it&#039;s allright. Could it be just me or does it look like a few of the responses come across like written by brain dead people? :-P And, if you are writing at other places, I&#039;d like to keep up with everything new you have to post. Could you make a list of the complete urls of your shared pages like your twitter feed, Facebook page or linkedin profile?]]></description>
