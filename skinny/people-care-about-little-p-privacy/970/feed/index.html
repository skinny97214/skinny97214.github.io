		<description><![CDATA[Hey Crystal,

Where are you getting this statement from? &quot;Many people aren’t having the browser save their passwords because it leaves their account wide open to anyone who has physical access to their device.&quot;

I took the sample test pilot data from 2 years ago here: https://testpilot.mozillalabs.com/testcases/password-distribution/aggregated-data.html

and found that 62% of users had at least one password saved in FF password manager. I completely agree about users caring more about people they know than nameless organizations.
