		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m updating the post since I&#039;ve added an Awaiting row. See above.

Todd, the colors indicate week. On Monday I change to a new color so I can see roughly how old the task is. The week that is pictured I was using pink. So you can see all four tasks in Today had been added that week. The blue task in Tomorrow was from the previous week. The This Week row is particularly incriminating as I have a purple task three weeks old.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m surprised you don&#039;t use multi-colored notes. I noticed you write notes with different colored pens- black, blue, purple, pin-ish. Does the different colored ink have any significance in your system? 

Do you still use Hiveminder to capture and plan long range projects and &quot;someday maybe&quot; stuff?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this! A good friend of mine, James T., sent me your way. We currently have a Post-It Notes Kanban board for our work items.

Although as much as I&#039;d like to carry a wall with me for personal TODOs, I&#039;m still on the hunt for a decent digital version (I&#039;ve tried astrid+rememberthemilk, astrid+producteev). Maybe I just need change the thought that that I need a digital version...]]></description>
