		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve found that just asking whether they&#039;ve worked with a designer in the past is enlightening. Then I ask them about the experience, what was successful and not successful in working together, what they learned from it, and how they deal with disagreements or trade-offs.

I think the important thing is to find an engineer who will value the contributions of a designer, not necessarily to discover what the engineer&#039;s design chops are. (This is of course unless the engineer is going to do design work aside from engineering).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How to interview a developer? Get another developer to do it. Only those with experience in the field can tell if the person is good or just bullshitting. But what question should a designer ask? Try: What is fluid design? If they know what that is, then you can (eventually) convince them of your design. ☺]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good questions, if somewhat basic. (Or maybe we just hire exceptional developers for the Firefox front-end team. ;-) But it does make we wonder what would be good design-related questions to ask as more in-depth followups when you&#039;re looking for a developers with _strong_ design skills. Hmm.

P.S. Did I mention we&#039;re hiring developers with design chops? :D http://careers.mozilla.org/en-US/position/omgDWfwV]]></description>
