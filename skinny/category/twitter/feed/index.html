<p>Depending on the mindset of whomever you ask, small talk is either the foundation of a good conversation or annoying prattle to be minimized as much as possible. I find the latter opinion to be often held by highly systematic thinkers who find communication to be stressful.</p>
<p>You can see this reluctance to jump into a conversation without small talk by listening to a radio call in show. When a caller is put on air, it takes them a second to collect themselves and launch into their thought. They often want to go through the usual rituals of starting a conversation, saying hello and complimenting the host. Even though the handlers have coached guests to get straight to the point, the hosts often have to prompt the guest again with &#8220;what&#8217;s your question.&#8221; The pressure is on to be as efficient in communication as possible, but most people fail because we&#8217;re socialized to preface our conversations.</p>
<p>The most efficient from the point of view of not using small talk are toddlers. They blurt out their requests without regard to whether the caregiver is listening or not. Through patient effort, they are socialized to request an audience first. This has its own difficult stage as the toddler repeats that request &#8220;mommy, mommy, mommy&#8230;&#8221; ad nauseum. </p>
<p>Fortunately we (mostly) all make it past these stages with proper adult manners to first request someone&#8217;s attention. Their response allows us judge the person&#8217;s mood and level of engagement so we may adjust our communication style.</p>
<p>Greetings and small talk persist beyond face to face and voice-only communication. Letters must include greeting to conform to ettiquete.</p>
<p>Direct message (DM) and text messaging (txt) aren&#8217;t subject to these etiquette rules because they are asynchronous.</p>
<p>Instant message (IM) is as close to synchronous conversation as we have in the text-based communication world. It&#8217;s close enough to a phone conversation that we often query to see if the person is there before launching into the conversation. It&#8217;s similar to making the phone ring. That&#8217;s why people say things like &#8220;psst,&#8221; &#8220;ping,&#8221; &#8220;u there,&#8221; or &#8220;hello?&#8221; as their first message.</p>
<p>To those of you who are annoyed by these greetings, keep in mind that the majority of folks find jumping right into a conversation rude. Please don&#8217;t inflict your Aspergers on the rest of us. Yes, etiquette changes to adapt to new technology, but I suspect this won&#8217;t be changing any time soon. All of the people who I would classify as exceptional communicators start off with a request for audience. Consider how you might respond in a way that will help the other person adjust their expectation of how much of your time and attention you have available for them.</p>

I have been eased into writing blog posts by the daily exercise of writing tweets. 140 characters was bite-sized enough for me to jump in without hesitation. It got me in the habit of publishing content and thinking about the best way to phrase things. And for people like me who aren&#8217;t good wordsmiths, it was an excellent lesson in brevity. God knows I have nothing to say. At least on twitter it&#8217;ll only hurt for a second. Blogging, on the other hand, has been a struggle for me. Although I&#8217;ve had this blog up for over a year, it languished with one post until about a week ago. In a fit of frustration, I tweeted that &#8220;every day I wish I was a better writer.&#8221; It&#8217;s true. I think more about being a better writer than I do about being a better designer.

I have been eased into writing blog posts by the daily exercise of writing tweets. 140 characters was bite-sized enough for me to jump in without hesitation.

<p>Blogging, on the other hand, has been a struggle for me. Although I&#8217;ve had this blog up for over a year, it languished with one post until about a week ago. In a fit of frustration, I tweeted that &#8220;every day I wish I was a better writer.&#8221; It&#8217;s true. I think more about being a better writer than I do about being a better designer. Strange. Folks like Stefan Sagmeister and Jonathan Ive are great designers partly because they&#8217;re great designers and partly because they can speak and write passionately to win over non-design folk who need words to tell them what their eyes cannot.</p>
<p>Writing was the subject this morning on OPB. Think Out Loud was interviewing Oregon&#8217;s Poet Laureate. It got me thinking about my own experience with learning to write as a child. I must&#8217;ve been in about second grade when a poetry teaching workshop came to my classroom. They introduced us to the existence of poetry by reading some nice poems. I can clearly remember listening to them and thinking &#8220;Oh, I get it. A poem is just some silly words mashed together.&#8221; At the end of the workshop they had us wee ones write our own poems. I took to this with purpose and thought up the most ridiculous, non-sequitur jumble of words I could manage. I believe it was a &#8220;poem&#8221; about a flying purple cat. A few months went by and I had forgotten the hippies and their silly workshop when a letter came in the mail that my story had been selected for publication. The little overachiever in me was thrilled to tack up yet another award.</p>
<p>The years have elapsed and the book has long been lost. I wish I could read that poem. I suspect that my attempt at absurdity still had a child&#8217;s strict need for a linear story. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;ve progressed much since then. I still find it hard to follow <a href="http://twitter.com/ceonyc">Charlie&#8217;s</a> advice. He said I never assume I have anything to say or than anyone will read it, I just write. </p>
<p>So I&#8217;m giving it another try. Please bear with me.</p>

It&#8217;s no surprise, the lower the effort, the lower the reward. The cost of contacting has to be factored into the decision of which tool to use to contact someone.</p>
<p><img src="/skinny/content/uploads/2010/06/collaboration_tools2.gif" alt="collaboration_tools2" title="collaboration_tools2" width="410" height="410" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76" /></p>
<p>Why aren&#8217;t sites like BaseCamp, PivotalTracker or Google Buzz (just kidding)  on this grid? Honestly, because I don&#8217;t know quite where they fall on the grid. They usually rely on hooks into email to notify of change. Also, because I&#8217;ve yet to work at a place that uses it and is completely happy with their system.</p>
<p>Here are some thoughts collected from twitter on what are the best tools and techniques for collaboration:</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/rgleeson">@rgleeson</a>: &#8220;Honestly? 1. Skype video (with shared screen), 2. Mobile device, and 3. google docs&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/tyeshasnow">@tyeshasnow</a>: &#8220;Sometimes old school verbal communication is the best way. Let&#8217;s all start picking up the phone more often 5 mins = 10 email exchanges.&#8221; I would argue a five minute conversation is equivalent to 100 email exchanges. No one is going to have that many. The two are almost not even comparable.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/al3x">@al3x</a>: &#8220;A few days ago, @danbenjamin and I had a conversation. Less tech, more process. You can listen to it at <a href="http://bit.ly/bsKoGI">http://bit.ly/bsKoGI</a>&#8221;<br />
If you listen in, at about 11:00 he talks about the collaboration when he was employed at Twitter. The gist of it is some of the best employees are remote. The collaboration that happens when you&#8217;re remote is higher value because you&#8217;re forced to put it into a place that&#8217;s visible to everyone. He continues on about other projects&#8230; only tangentially related to collaboration, but interesting nonetheless.</p>
<p>For me, the golden chalice of collaboration would be to recreate the serendipity created by working in the same physical space in a remote setup. I think the advantages of working remotely are well established: ability to work with the best people despite geography, tailoring your schedule and workspace to suit, etc. However, you loose the serendipity of casual chatter &#8211; the ability to spin your chair around and have a five minute consult with your coworker.</p>
<p>My next experiment to capture that is to hijack twitter for this purpose. Using a tool that can monitor multiple accounts such as CoTweet or HootSuite makes it possible to do this without going crazy. Create a private twitter account. Follow your virtual coworkers&#8217; private accounts. Chatter away! My hope is that by tapping into one of the screens that I&#8217;m already paying attention to during the day that I&#8217;ll minimize the effort involved. Why private? To allow more unfiltered and/or top-secret conversations. Also, to function as a filter so that you can switch into that conversation among a small number of folks.</p>
<p>As always, I&#8217;m writing about this not because I consider myself to be any authority but to draw out critiques and ideas from you guys. Comments are most welcome.</p>

At SXSW, I declared new follower bankruptcy and simply deleted all of the emails. It&#8217;s a shame, though, because I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m missing friends, both new and old.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to receive any email at all from users that follow more folks that follow them back. Maybe 1:1 is too harsh, so you could use 1:1.5. Ideally, each user would be able to set their own custom threshold. That&#8217;s it. I did a little analysis of my last 100 followers to see what effect this simple filter would have. Right off the top, this would eliminate more than half of my new follower notices, almost entirely commercial interests or outright spammers.</p>

<p>I realize that spammers and marketers would adjust their tactics to dodge this simple filter. They could be more aggressive in following and then unfollowing the folks that don&#8217;t follow back to keep their ratios below the range. It seems like this would raise a big red flag for Twitter to be able to block them accordingly.</p>
<p>It would also point out to new (and old) marketing interests that following tons and tons of people isn&#8217;t the best way to make friends. This would hopefully encourage better behavior from legitimate businesses.</p>
<p>One objection to this is that it would make it hard for new users to get started. I would argue that they can @reply the people they are interested in. I&#8217;ve seen several established members of the community send out a tweet welcoming a new user to the group.</p>
<p>Recognizing that there is a continuum of ways twitter can be used, I broke it down into three broad categories. I defined an individual as someone without an overtly commercial interest. These were people I thought were following me because they genuinely wanted to read my tweets. Marketing included companies and non-profits. There were a couple of folks that represented themselves under their own name, but were clearly there on behalf of a company. I marked an account as spam if they had a fraudulent-looking product or were generally obnoxious.</p>
<p>A couple users defied categorization. Take @threewolfman as an example. I marked him as an individual because he had no obvious profit motive, but he wasn&#8217;t there representing himself. @lucky22469 was just gaming the system to get as many followers as possible, only for ego it appears. There weren&#8217;t enough fake accounts and miscellaneous following me to warrant their own category.</p>
