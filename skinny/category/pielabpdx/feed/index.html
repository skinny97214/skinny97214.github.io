You can read about all the <a href="/skinny/category/pielabpdx/">shenanigans</a> right here on this little blog. In short, I put up a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1673171669/pielab-a-game-laboratory-food-cart-by-skinny">Kickstarter project</a> and successfully funded a behavioral experiment masquerading as a pop-up pie cart. I was in the <a href="http://wweek.com/editorial/3643/14449/">Willamette Week</a> and on KGW news. I had <a href="http://yfrog.com/6p44pz">crazy lines</a> around the block. I sold out every day but one. MADNESS!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/skinny/content/uploads/2010/10/chalkboard.jpg"><img src="/skinny/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/chalkboard-600x450.jpg" alt="" title="chalkboard" width="600" height="450" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-199" /></a></p>
<p>The past three weeks I&#8217;ve been playing some variation on letting people pay whatever they want to. The first week I told customers they could pay me however much they thought it was worth. I removed the tip jar and put a question mark on the menu board in the place of the price. Many folks asked how much it usually cost and I told them I wasn&#8217;t allowed to tell. I recorded how much they paid by chalking up tally marks next the prices per slice 3, 4, 5, 6 &#8230; I was surprised that I had to add 7, 8 and 9. Although I did have a few outliers in those high and low, most people handed me a $5 bill and didn&#8217;t ask for change back.</p>
<p>The next week I also let people pay however much they would like, but this time it was a secret to me. I had them take a fresh envelope out of the box and enclose their payment. This time they could truly pay whatever they wanted without the social pressure of me staring them in the eye. If they needed change they could hand me the large bill and I would break it so I still wouldn&#8217;t know how much they were contributing. The full envelope went into the second box and they went on their merry way. After the service was over I took the box back and tallied the amount in each one. My mistake was that I didn&#8217;t have the customers write how many slices they were paying for. If an envelope had six dollars, is that for one slice or two? I do know that I made the same number of servings from this week to the last. Unfortunately, the data for this weeks is not as solid as the previous week.</p>
<p>The third week I repeated the same envelope experiment. This time I had customers report the number of slices on the outside of the envelope. Also, I explained to each person that all proceeds of the cart for this day would benefit The <a href="http://nationalmall.org">Trust for the National Mall</a> in Washington, DC. I wanted to see if this would raise the median amount per person.</p>
<p>Why this nonprofit? It is the recommended charity for the <a href="http://rallytorestoresanity.com">Rally to Restore Sanity</a> coming up in two weeks which I am lucky enough to be attending. It seemed like a good choice because it is a politically neutral charity that presumably is acceptable to a large majority of people. </p>
<p>Side note: The two weeks of envelope experiments had a super wonderful side effect of me not touching the money very much. I only needed to break bills for a handful of folks. This allowed me to not have to switch back and forth between needing clean hands to cut pie and then handling money. I could ditch the plastic gloves. Yay! It also dramatically speeded the transaction, definitely a good thing since I&#8217;ve had mad long lines lately.</p>
<p>Results, already! </p>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#8217;ve been a busy bee serving smiling customers at PieLabPDX. Since my last post three weeks ago I&#8217;ve been up to some mischief both new and old. For those of you who aren&#8217;t familiar with the story, that&#8217;s the original idea that inspired the cart. In this experiment, customers get the order of the person in line ahead of them. Whatever they order goes to the lucky one to come after them, creating a chain of connected people. I finally mustered the courage to play Pie It Forward. I was nervous to play because I was taking all control over which pie flavor the customer would receive. This wasn&#8217;t an optional game. The customer could either take the risk or walk away. A common question was &#8220;What flavor did they pick for me?&#8221; I wouldn&#8217;t tell. They had to agree to play before I would reveal their fate.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been a busy bee serving smiling customers at PieLabPDX. Since my last post three weeks ago I&#8217;ve been up to some mischief both new and old.<br />
<div id="attachment_155" style="width: 309px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="/skinny/content/uploads/2010/09/berry_pie.jpg"><img src="/skinny/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/berry_pie.jpg" alt="" title="berry_pie" width="299" height="500" class="size-full wp-image-155" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">photo by @pdxfoodcarts</p></div></p>
<p>For those of you who aren&#8217;t familiar with the story, that&#8217;s the original idea that inspired the cart. In this experiment, customers get the order of the person in line ahead of them. Whatever they order goes to the lucky one to come after them, creating a chain of connected people. </p>
<p>I finally mustered the courage to play Pie It Forward. I was nervous to play because I was taking all control over which pie flavor the customer would receive. This wasn&#8217;t an optional game. The customer could either take the risk or walk away. A common question was &#8220;What flavor did they pick for me?&#8221; I wouldn&#8217;t tell. They had to agree to play before I would reveal their fate. </p>
<p>I was interested in finding out why people ordered what they did for the person to follow. The overwhelming majority chose a flavor they they found superior and they believed the next person would enjoy. One lady was from England and chose rhubarb for the customer behind her because she thought it was an under appreciated flavor here. Conversely, one guy wasn&#8217;t pleased that he received cherry. He chose cherry for the next person because &#8220;that&#8217;s what happened to me.&#8221; Heehee.</p>
<p>Only one person out of about forty walked away. He walked up and I described the game to him. His reaction &#8220;No. No, I don&#8217;t think so.&#8221; and wandered away. He wasn&#8217;t mean or angry, just politely declined.</p>
<p>Small groups of friends come together to have a little pie break. In these cases, they always elected someone who would take the risk of receiving the mystery pie flavor. Then the rest of them would get what they wanted. I believe the game aspect encourages people to come with friends.</p>
<p>I encouraged conversation between the folks in line, saying things like &#8220;you better make this guy right ahead of you your new best friend. He&#8217;s going to be the one choosing which flavor you get.&#8221; This generally worked well. There&#8217;s a cheerful mood around the pie cart, as you can imagine. Often times customers would hang around the cart and chat, which is a great dynamic to have. </p>
<p>I had fun. The customers (generally) had fun. I sold out in 2 1/2 hours. I declared it a success.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_143" style="width: 420px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="/skinny/content/uploads/2010/09/wheel_of_fortune-410x394.jpg" alt="wheel of fortune" title="wheel_of_fortune" width="410" height="394" class="size-medium wp-image-143" /><p class="wp-caption-text">wheel of fortune</p></div>
<p>The beautiful wheel of fortune was installed on the cart two weeks ago and I&#8217;ve been putting it to use ever since. It has a chalkboard finish, so I can change the options and relative probability of each. There are approximately fifty spaces with one special half size space. Its pegs are painted red and there is always a super charged prize or woe. The chance of landing on it is about 1 in 100. These first two weeks the special space held a free slice of pie. So far I&#8217;ve given away a free slice to one lucky guy.</p>
<p>For the last two weeks, I&#8217;ve been using the wheel to list pie flavors. Each week, there has been a flavor that is more limited in quantity. I assign it fewer spaces so it won&#8217;t run out too soon. Once the pie flavors start running short, the game becomes less fun so I want to extend those as long as possible.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, I gave customers the option to spin the wheel or, if they knew what they wanted, choose the flavor. This is an optional game. People didn&#8217;t have to spin unless they wanted to and the only real incentive was the special free space. 34% spun the wheel.</p>
<p>Last week, I gave them the same option to spin or choose, but this time there was a $1.00 discount if you spun the wheel. This time 50% spun. </p>
<p><img src="/skinny/content/uploads/2010/09/spin_vs_choose.gif" alt="spin_vs_choose" title="spin_vs_choose" width="410" height="435" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146" /></p>
<p>These experiments need to be repeated to get a larger sample size, but early results are that most of the people who are spinning are doing so simply for the fun of it. Financial incentives certainly do sway the number of people who will take a chance but I expected the bump to be more than 15%. </p>
<p>I also tracked whether the folks who chose did so because they wanted a certain flavor or to avoid an unpleasant choice. 76% were choosing to choose instead of spin because they knew what they wanted. </p>
<p>Many people have suggested that I provide a bad flavor to see how that changes things. I think this is a valid point, but I don&#8217;t know exactly how to implement. What one person sees as a bad flavor (see rhubarb, gooseberry) is the next guy&#8217;s favorite. I&#8217;m mulling it over, but it is against my cooking sensibilities to make something truly awful like earwax flavor.</p>

<p>The first day, delayed though it was, went off without a hitch. I met the City of Portland inspector at 11pm and he issued me my sidewalk permit without further hassle. Whew. </p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t been blogging much because the large part of what I&#8217;ve been learning is about the intricacies of Portland zoning, permitting, and food safety. I&#8217;ll summarize to say that I&#8217;m finally done paying for permits and the total bill is just slightly under $1100. Those permits are calendar year and NOT prorated. So that huge sum is good for four months. It appears that prorating the first year is just too much math for our good government officials. I commiserated with other cart owners who had no pity on me, saying that they have eleven permits to my four so suck it up. First lesson, starting a cart is more expensive than you think.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<p><em>Cutting and serving pie is sticky business</em>. I need gloves. If I&#8217;m going to record tallies of game play with a pen and paper, I need to be able to quickly go from sticky hands to clean hands. The devil is in the details, you know.</p>
<p><em>I need to make more pie</em>. I wanted to ramp up gently, so Friday I made four pies and a double cobbler, roughly 45 servings. I sold out in two hours. TWO HOURS! There were lines of a dozen folks at a couple of points throughout the afternoon. </p>
<p><em>People loves some piez.</em> A lady with a dog walked around the corner and exclaimed &#8220;Oh my god, is that pie?!?&#8221; There were many groups of people that had a major rubberneck as they walked by. The mailman looked longingly and then came back later. Really, it was quite comical. Also, people are very likely to chat it up. I think pie has a nostalgic emotional connection. I don&#8217;t think I could&#8217;ve picked a better item as lure for my social experiments.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, the first game was Rock Paper Scissors. I was amazed to find that <em>not everyone remembers exactly how to play</em>. I picked it because I wanted to do something very light weight that everyone would relate to. I was right that everyone seems to have played it at one point, but I did have to give a little refresher to a handful. </p>
<p>I also learned that I<em>&#8216;m a force to be reckoned with at Rock Paper Scissors</em>. Even though I was actively trying to lose, I won about 70% of the time. (I&#8217;ll track such stats more precisely in the future. See note about sticky fingers.)</p>
<p>Conversely, <em>I&#8217;m a total softy</em>. If someone had already told me what they wanted, inadvertently or not, I gave them what they wanted even if I won. In cases where there was a group of people in line, I encouraged them to engineer a trade. I&#8217;m looking forward to games with the wheel where my agency isn&#8217;t required or allowed.</p>
<p>When people won (returning them to the state at which you normally find yourself when ordering at a cart, namely, being able to pick what you get) they were extremely excited. It brought out a childlike happiness for many. Remember that mailman? It was bizarre and wonderful to ask him to Rock Paper Scissors with me. </p>
<p>It was pretty hilarious that just putting something at stake, essentially a wager, meant there was a <em>palpable thrill of the kill</em>. I was reminded of how much more fun blackjack and poker are when you&#8217;re betting real money. Without the wager, they&#8217;re pretty dull actually. The biggest adrenaline was when there was a line of people who&#8217;d been defeated by my skills. If three people in a row went down, the fourth customer to step up felt like they were coming up against a pitcher on a no-hit streak. When they won, it was pure joy.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait for next week! The custom crafted wheel of fortune has been attached. Much fun and mischief will ensue.</p>

We&#8217;re located at NW 12th and Davis and are open Fridays from noon till the pies sell out. Hopefully, I&#8217;ll be hiring some employees to be open more days of the week soon.</p>

<p>Let me give you an example of one game that we&#8217;ll play that actually was the inspiration for it all.

The person who comes after them will get what they ordered. It&#8217;s a big chain. You can elect to set the person after you for a sweet treat.</p>
<p>Back to the pie: the cart will serve beautiful slices of homemade pies. The flavors will be mostly tried and true recipes from my granny but there will be the occasional gourmand flavor like Momofuku&#8217;s chocolate pie that has a cult following in NYC. A la mode? Of course, and there will be an ever-ready pot of fresh coffee at hand.</p>
<p>Again, a giant thanks to all of those who made the <a href="http://bit.ly/pieLabPDX">Kickstarter project</a> a success! We raised $1650 to help cover the costs of the construction, permitting, and insurance. Hugs to all!</p>
<p>I debuted at <a href="http://30hourday.org">30 Hour Day,</a> a livestreaming telathon to benefit the Oregon Food Bank this past Saturday. Have a look at the beautiful pics!</p>
