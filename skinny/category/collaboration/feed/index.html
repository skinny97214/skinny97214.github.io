<p>In an exasperated voice <em>&#8220;Why is it so hard to get designers in open source.&#8221;</em> I hear this all the time. Well firstly, it depends on what sorts of skills you&#8217;re talking about. Just like in code, there are small tactical problems that are good first bugs. Even the simplest issue requires a knowledge of the design patterns that the site employs.</p>
<p>Many of the bugs, however, require a deep understanding of why the product exists in the marketplace and a thorough understanding of the research that underpins the project. These strategic questions are analogous to what a software architect would do. I was on the Persona project full time for three months before I felt confident making significant choices about UX.</p>
<p>Open source generally isn&#8217;t welcoming to designers. A shock, I know! There are many reasons for this.</p>
<ol>
<li>In general, <strong>coders don&#8217;t know what to expect from us</strong>. My conception of what I do often bears little resemblance to what coders think I do. When I join a team that&#8217;s never worked closely with a UX designer, I have to educate them. Otherwise, there&#8217;s a gap of misunderstanding that leads to stress and unhappiness. We get up in your business and ask you to change things that you don&#8217;t want to change because
<ul>
<li>It seems trivial and unimportant.</li>
<li>Conversely, it&#8217;s <em>too hard</em>.</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t agree.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ultimately, we&#8217;re beholden to convince a dev to implement our bug, likely because we don&#8217;t code or even if we do it&#8217;s not the best use of our time to be implementing. (If you want to pick a fight, insult a designer by asking why we don&#8217;t &#8220;just learn to code.&#8221;) We&#8217;re starting from a disadvantaged position. In version control systems such as github, <strong>code talks and designers don&#8217;t speak the language</strong>.</li>
<li>Probably the most daunting question for projects without any design lead that has the trust of the team is, <strong>how do the devs know if the proposed design is correct</strong>? Without that trust, bugs quickly devolve into nasty arguments. How you build that trust has been the subject of entire books. But the question remains, who and how do you approve a mockup? The code review process works great for just that&#8230; code.</li>
<li>Github issues and their parallels track problems at a level of granularity that&#8217;s useful for devs. The UX problems that constitute my work are of a much larger granularity. When I add such a strategic issues to the tracker, it makes devs uncomfortable. There&#8217;s nothing actionable here. There&#8217;s nothing to implement. My job is to think through big issues. By the time I&#8217;ve converted it into something a dev would recognize as a bug, my work is done. Thus, <strong>representing the work of a designer requires a shift in culture</strong> of the dev team so that they won&#8217;t close down my issues.</li>
<li>My UX bugs are all tracked publicly in <a title="Persona Issues on Github" href="https://github.com/mozilla/browserid/issues">Persona&#8217;s github</a> and yet I can count on one hand the number of UX volunteers that have contributed to the project. It&#8217;s not that there aren&#8217;t any good first bugs, its that <strong>there is a shortage of UX/UI designers in the market</strong>. Yes, I&#8217;m sure Mozilla could do a better job of getting designers to volunteer. We know it and we&#8217;re working on it.</li>
</ol>
<p>The solutions to all these problems lie in communication and building a trusted relationship. It&#8217;s a higher barrier for designers that takes time to overcome. I&#8217;ve found all of my team to be receptive when I&#8217;ve taken the time to explain the principles that guide my decisions. I work with an awesome group of super smart folks! They just need to know I&#8217;ve got this handled. The longer we work together, the more shorthanded my explanations can be. Designers start by renovating small stuff and move up to innovating as they build their reputation. As the paid UX designers in Mozilla change the culture, it will become more welcoming because we will have laid the groundwork.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I visited <a title="ziba industrial design agency" href="http://ziba.com">Ziba</a> on a sunny, crisp fall day. (Yes, we do have them at least once a decade here in Portland.) One of their talented creative directors, Kai Halsinger, was generous enough to show me around the studio and talk about what makes it all work. Specifically on my mind was how their physical space influence the work they do. This building was carefully considered to support their creative process.</p>
<p>A little background for those unfamiliar: Ziba is an experience design firm here in Portland. If you&#8217;ve seen a recent Wacom tablet or the beautifully high-low TDK boombox, you&#8217;ve appreciated their <a href="http://www.ziba.com/#/work/">work</a>.</p>
<p>Two things stood out to me about their offices.</p>
<p><a href="/skinny/content/uploads/2011/11/ziba-names.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-642" title="ziba-names" src="/skinny/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/ziba-names-600x414.jpg" alt="ziba emphasis on individual contributors" width="600" height="414" /></a></p>
<h3>Emphasis on the individual contributor</h3>
<p>Yes, the giant roboman is awesome, but look across. Right when you walk in the lobby, the wall behind reception is covered in the names of the employees. It might seem like a small thing, that is unless you are one of the names on the wall. The list contains the current employees in chronological order of when they started to work for Ziba. The talent is really all information/innovation companies are. This might not resonate as much in non-Westerners where the highest good is to be part of a whole, but from this little girl from Arkansas, much respect.</p>
<p><a href="/skinny/content/uploads/2011/11/ziba-project-rooms.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-637" title="ziba-project-room" src="/skinny/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/ziba-project-rooms-600x440.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<h3>Project rooms</h3>
<p>The desks at Ziba are kept deliberately small. There are no cubes. The desks are arranged into long rows. Funny thing was, almost no one was at their desk. Kai said and observation confirmed, folks spend the majority of their time inside project rooms. The uninitiated might assume it was merely a conference room where no one had bothered to clean all the stuff off the walls.</p>
<p>This space was organized around the core idea that the best, most creative work is done when you get people out from behind their desks into a big room. Squeezed together around a big table, people can cheat off their neighbor&#8217;s test paper, or as we call it in the professional world, cross-pollination. As they develop concepts, mockups are printed out and pinned around the room. They have giant format plotters for printing oversize documents. There are post-its from various brainstorming methodologies confettied across the walls. Whiteboards are covered in elegant scrawls.</p>
<p>Because the room is dedicated to a client, you never have to clear off the walls to make room for someone else. The cruft can accumulate. The importance of this not obvious at first, but is key to the creative process. You have to absorb the idea or form for at least a few days. The most important benefit of the project rooms is to never lose ideas &#8211; pin them up &#8211; and then to be able to connect previously disjointed thoughts or see new patterns that spark further ideas. This space allows time for designs to live and breathe so you can properly figure out what is working. You&#8217;ll walk in one morning and it&#8217;ll be obvious what to do next. This can&#8217;t be rushed.</p>
<p>Ziba generally keeps one project room per client. There may be more than one project in the room at a time. It&#8217;s a big benefit to keep the design languages consistent as each takes shape.</p>
<p>I also spoke to <a title="twitter - Bill DeRouchey" href="https://twitter.com/#!/billder">Bill DeRouchey</a>, former Interim Director when this building was brand new. He was in their previous space as well. The project rooms there had been retrofitted into the existing footprint, not as perfectly. He said they didn&#8217;t have enough for all of the work to go in project rooms, so mockups, notes, cruft flowed out into the halls. Some of the best insights were from someone not assigned to that client randomly walking by and stopping to take a look. It&#8217;s an open question whether the serendipity from this imperfection is worth more than the clean beauty and efficiency of the current space.</p>
<p>Kai said clients make great effort and take great pleasure in coming to work in &#8220;their&#8221; project rooms with the creative teams. I asked how they extended the experience when clients aren&#8217;t able to travel on a regular basis. Not surprisingly, they&#8217;ve cooked up a clever solution. There is a panoramic camera that takes a 360 degree shot so they can pan and zoom around and see how things are morphing.</p>
<p>I hope to steal this trick and the project room concept for Mozilla. Project rooms are by no means a shocking new idea for agencies. They&#8217;ve been using them for years. I&#8217;m writing this to bring it to light so that engineering-driven companies who have in-house design groups like Mozilla can steal this idea. Designers&#8217; needs are distinct from developers and not so obvious.</p>
<p>The key bits are</p>
<ul>
<li>expansive whiteboards</li>
<li>pinboards</li>
<li>post-its</li>
<li>a way of printing things out in large format</li>
<li>a large conference table in the middle</li>
<li>a great team that constantly curates the room and evolves the vision</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, Ziba is an inspiring, beautiful place filled with unnecessarily clever (ok, maybe necessarily clever) people. I suspect it&#8217;s a wonderful space to come to every day.</p>

Even though the handlers have coached guests to get straight to the point, the hosts often have to prompt the guest again with &#8220;what&#8217;s your question.&#8221; The pressure is on to be as efficient in communication as possible, but most people fail because we&#8217;re socialized to preface our conversations.</p>
<p>The most efficient from the point of view of not using small talk are toddlers. They blurt out their requests without regard to whether the caregiver is listening or not. Through patient effort, they are socialized to request an audience first. This has its own difficult stage as the toddler repeats that request &#8220;mommy, mommy, mommy&#8230;&#8221; ad nauseum. </p>
<p>Fortunately we (mostly) all make it past these stages with proper adult manners to first request someone&#8217;s attention. Their response allows us judge the person&#8217;s mood and level of engagement so we may adjust our communication style.</p>
<p>Greetings and small talk persist beyond face to face and voice-only communication. Letters must include greeting to conform to ettiquete.</p>
<p>Direct message (DM) and text messaging (txt) aren&#8217;t subject to these etiquette rules because they are asynchronous.</p>
<p>Instant message (IM) is as close to synchronous conversation as we have in the text-based communication world. It&#8217;s close enough to a phone conversation that we often query to see if the person is there before launching into the conversation. It&#8217;s similar to making the phone ring. That&#8217;s why people say things like &#8220;psst,&#8221; &#8220;ping,&#8221; &#8220;u there,&#8221; or &#8220;hello?&#8221; as their first message.</p>
<p>To those of you who are annoyed by these greetings, keep in mind that the majority of folks find jumping right into a conversation rude. Please don&#8217;t inflict your Aspergers on the rest of us. Yes, etiquette changes to adapt to new technology, but I suspect this won&#8217;t be changing any time soon. All of the people who I would classify as exceptional communicators start off with a request for audience. Consider how you might respond in a way that will help the other person adjust their expectation of how much of your time and attention you have available for them.</p>

<p>Why aren&#8217;t sites like BaseCamp, PivotalTracker or Google Buzz (just kidding)  on this grid? Honestly, because I don&#8217;t know quite where they fall on the grid. They usually rely on hooks into email to notify of change. Also, because I&#8217;ve yet to work at a place that uses it and is completely happy with their system.</p>
<p>Here are some thoughts collected from twitter on what are the best tools and techniques for collaboration:</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/rgleeson">@rgleeson</a>: &#8220;Honestly? 1. Skype video (with shared screen), 2. Mobile device, and 3. google docs&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/tyeshasnow">@tyeshasnow</a>: &#8220;Sometimes old school verbal communication is the best way. Let&#8217;s all start picking up the phone more often 5 mins = 10 email exchanges.&#8221; I would argue a five minute conversation is equivalent to 100 email exchanges. No one is going to have that many. The two are almost not even comparable.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/al3x">@al3x</a>: &#8220;A few days ago, @danbenjamin and I had a conversation. Less tech, more process. You can listen to it at <a href="http://bit.ly/bsKoGI">http://bit.ly/bsKoGI</a>&#8221;<br />
If you listen in, at about 11:00 he talks about the collaboration when he was employed at Twitter. The gist of it is some of the best employees are remote. The collaboration that happens when you&#8217;re remote is higher value because you&#8217;re forced to put it into a place that&#8217;s visible to everyone. He continues on about other projects&#8230; only tangentially related to collaboration, but interesting nonetheless.</p>
<p>For me, the golden chalice of collaboration would be to recreate the serendipity created by working in the same physical space in a remote setup. I think the advantages of working remotely are well established: ability to work with the best people despite geography, tailoring your schedule and workspace to suit, etc. However, you loose the serendipity of casual chatter &#8211; the ability to spin your chair around and have a five minute consult with your coworker.</p>
<p>My next experiment to capture that is to hijack twitter for this purpose. Using a tool that can monitor multiple accounts such as CoTweet or HootSuite makes it possible to do this without going crazy. Create a private twitter account. Follow your virtual coworkers&#8217; private accounts. Chatter away! My hope is that by tapping into one of the screens that I&#8217;m already paying attention to during the day that I&#8217;ll minimize the effort involved. Why private? To allow more unfiltered and/or top-secret conversations. Also, to function as a filter so that you can switch into that conversation among a small number of folks.</p>
<p>As always, I&#8217;m writing about this not because I consider myself to be any authority but to draw out critiques and ideas from you guys. Comments are most welcome.</p>
