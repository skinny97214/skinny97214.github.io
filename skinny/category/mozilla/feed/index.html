<h3>Age Neutral Verification</h3>
<p>This is the biggest area of impact on the interface. If you have a site which offers kid-attractive content, you&#8217;ll need to know if they&#8217;re above thirteen before making an account or storing personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>The problem is that you can&#8217;t actually ask that in a way that indicates that thirteen is the break point. This is what &#8220;age-neutral verification&#8221; means. If only it was as simple as a checkbox that they tick which says &#8220;I am over 13 years of age.&#8221; Nuuuh-uh, not so fast, cowboy. That&#8217;s not legal. (See <a title="COPPA FAQs" href="http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm" target="_blank">FAQ #39 of the COPPA statute</a>.)</p>
<p>If the user fails the age-neutral test, <strong>you must fail in a obtuse way</strong> that doesn&#8217;t indicate to them that the age check was the reason. This defies all good UX principles around writing clear error message that tell people what is actually going on. As much as this boils my cockles, it is the law. But it doesn&#8217;t end there. You must prevent them from turning around trying again. Finally, your company must delete all info from any source that you have about that user.</p>
<h3>Options</h3>
<p><a href="/skinny/content/uploads/2013/04/coppa-birthday-facebook.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1034 alignnone" alt="coppa birthday example from facebook" src="/skinny/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/coppa-birthday-facebook.png" width="511" height="83" /></a></p>
<p>Most providers, including the screenshot from Facebook, are asking for a birth date, as that&#8217;s the example solution given in the law. Facebook&#8217;s popup delicately explains &#8220;Providing your birthday helps make sure you get the right Facebook experience for your age. You can choose to hide this info from your timeline later if you want. For more details, please visit our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/">Data Use Policy</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="/skinny/content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-01-at-2.05.42-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1039" alt="COPPA birth year" src="/skinny/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-01-at-2.05.42-PM.png" width="432" height="100" /></a></p>
<p>Another option is to simplify down to only asking for the birth year. The drawback to this method is that you need to toss out all of the people who turned thirteen that calendar year who would otherwise be able to use your site.</p>
<p><a href="/skinny/content/uploads/2013/04/age-neutral-btwf.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1037 alignnone" alt="Age Neutral Verification BTWF" src="/skinny/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/age-neutral-btwf.png" width="299" height="116" /></a></p>
<p>Lastly, my favorite option is the radio buttons with age ranges approach. This example is from the Born This Way Foundation. It&#8217;s the best UX but the riskiest approach from a legal standpoint.</p>
<h3>Tricks up our sleeve</h3>
<p>Since Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo all are under the same restrictions, they have already asked this question of users. A feature we&#8217;ve been talking about for <a title="Mozilla Persona : the official blog" href="http://identity.mozilla.com/" target="_blank">Persona</a> is to flag such users&#8217; accounts as good to go. As we roll this future feature out, this will mean that we can give sites both a verified email address and a verified age-neutral check.  Again, check with your lawyers to see what sort of documentation you&#8217;ll need to keep around to prove that these third parties were indeed performing the check.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a common perception that people don&#8217;t care about privacy. This is sort of right. Our research shows that most users are unaware of how extensively they&#8217;re being <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/view/424170/how-facebook-leveraged-publishers-desperation-to/">tracked by advertisers</a> across the websites they visit. Even those that do know are unsure of what to do about it. They know there&#8217;s a horrible legalese privacy policy hanging out somewhere. They know they <em>should</em> read it. They don&#8217;t. They know they <em>should</em> use different passwords on each site. They don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Our research found a fatalistic attitude towards privacy and security. We heard everything from &#8220;No one wants my identity anyway. There&#8217;s no money in my bank account.*&#8221; to &#8220;If a hacker wanted to get in, I&#8217;m sure they could. I wouldn&#8217;t even know where to begin to defend myself.&#8221; <em>*Note: that&#8217;s not how identity theft works.</em></p>
<p>The kind of privacy they care about is from the people closest to them that could physically pick up their phone or computer. This is why people clear browser history and explicitly log out of sites. It&#8217;s not the hacker they&#8217;re worried about, it&#8217;s their visiting mother-in-law or kid sister getting a look at their email or being able to vandalize their Facebook wall. Unlike the big &#8220;P&#8221; privacy, this consequences of this threat are immediate and visceral. The potential costs to their reputation are perceived to be higher than anything a hacker could or would do.</p>
<p>Further, we found that the existing password manager is under serving the majority of our users. Many people aren&#8217;t having the browser save their passwords because it leaves their account wide open to anyone who has physical access to their device. It doesn&#8217;t defend against the primary threat they&#8217;re worried about. They are left with no tools to help.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s little wonder we see such bad statistics on password reuse. We&#8217;ve told people not reuse passwords, but it&#8217;s a cognitive impossibility to comply. It&#8217;s like saying you could avoid drowning by walking on water. Worse, even, is that everyone I&#8217;ve interviewed apologies for not having a good enough memory. We&#8217;ve done no service to our users by making them feel stupid or inadequate.</p>
<p>The Persona team has been busy prototyping better tools that address this set of user needs. Follow us on twitter at <a title="Mozilla Persona on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/mozillapersona" target="_blank">@mozillapersona</a> to hear about these experiments and more.</p>

<p>In an exasperated voice <em>&#8220;Why is it so hard to get designers in open source.&#8221;</em> I hear this all the time. Well firstly, it depends on what sorts of skills you&#8217;re talking about. Just like in code, there are small tactical problems that are good first bugs. Even the simplest issue requires a knowledge of the design patterns that the site employs.</p>
<p>Many of the bugs, however, require a deep understanding of why the product exists in the marketplace and a thorough understanding of the research that underpins the project. These strategic questions are analogous to what a software architect would do. I was on the Persona project full time for three months before I felt confident making significant choices about UX.</p>
<p>Open source generally isn&#8217;t welcoming to designers. A shock, I know! There are many reasons for this.</p>
<ol>
<li>In general, <strong>coders don&#8217;t know what to expect from us</strong>. My conception of what I do often bears little resemblance to what coders think I do. When I join a team that&#8217;s never worked closely with a UX designer, I have to educate them. Otherwise, there&#8217;s a gap of misunderstanding that leads to stress and unhappiness. We get up in your business and ask you to change things that you don&#8217;t want to change because
<ul>
<li>It seems trivial and unimportant.</li>
<li>Conversely, it&#8217;s <em>too hard</em>.</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t agree.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ultimately, we&#8217;re beholden to convince a dev to implement our bug, likely because we don&#8217;t code or even if we do it&#8217;s not the best use of our time to be implementing. (If you want to pick a fight, insult a designer by asking why we don&#8217;t &#8220;just learn to code.&#8221;) We&#8217;re starting from a disadvantaged position. In version control systems such as github, <strong>code talks and designers don&#8217;t speak the language</strong>.</li>
<li>Probably the most daunting question for projects without any design lead that has the trust of the team is, <strong>how do the devs know if the proposed design is correct</strong>? Without that trust, bugs quickly devolve into nasty arguments. How you build that trust has been the subject of entire books. But the question remains, who and how do you approve a mockup? The code review process works great for just that&#8230; code.</li>
<li>Github issues and their parallels track problems at a level of granularity that&#8217;s useful for devs. The UX problems that constitute my work are of a much larger granularity. When I add such a strategic issues to the tracker, it makes devs uncomfortable. There&#8217;s nothing actionable here. There&#8217;s nothing to implement. My job is to think through big issues. By the time I&#8217;ve converted it into something a dev would recognize as a bug, my work is done. Thus, <strong>representing the work of a designer requires a shift in culture</strong> of the dev team so that they won&#8217;t close down my issues.</li>
<li>My UX bugs are all tracked publicly in <a title="Persona Issues on Github" href="https://github.com/mozilla/browserid/issues">Persona&#8217;s github</a> and yet I can count on one hand the number of UX volunteers that have contributed to the project. It&#8217;s not that there aren&#8217;t any good first bugs, its that <strong>there is a shortage of UX/UI designers in the market</strong>. Yes, I&#8217;m sure Mozilla could do a better job of getting designers to volunteer. We know it and we&#8217;re working on it.</li>
</ol>
<p>The solutions to all these problems lie in communication and building a trusted relationship. It&#8217;s a higher barrier for designers that takes time to overcome. I&#8217;ve found all of my team to be receptive when I&#8217;ve taken the time to explain the principles that guide my decisions. I work with an awesome group of super smart folks! They just need to know I&#8217;ve got this handled. The longer we work together, the more shorthanded my explanations can be. Designers start by renovating small stuff and move up to innovating as they build their reputation. As the paid UX designers in Mozilla change the culture, it will become more welcoming because we will have laid the groundwork.

<p>Yes, this is a post about Mozilla, but you can generalize to any open-source software project. At every conference I hear the same refrain, &#8220;Why is design so hard in open source?&#8221; It&#8217;s so hard because *drumroll please* it&#8217;s not made a priority. None of the top decision-makers are designers. Period. The End. You can stop reading.</p>
<p>Without someone in the c-level or steering committee with a design background to speak on users&#8217; behalf, Mozilla is missing out. Engineers and business people see entirely different challenges. Without all sides (technical needs, business needs, user needs), we have a giant blind spot.</p>
<h3>Chief of Experience? Never heard of one.</h3>
<p>If everyone jumped off the bridge, would you do it too? It&#8217;s true, there aren&#8217;t many tech companies, especially open-source ones that have a design representative at the executive level. Google, Microsoft, Opera, Facebook, Intel, Amazon and even Adobe lack it. There are some surprising companies that do. Oracle has a Chief Evangelist of User Experience. Flipboard has a Head of Design. Nokia and Yahoo have a Senior VP of Design. You might&#8217;ve heard of the most notable SVP of Design, Johnny Ive of Apple. You&#8217;ll note titles of this position haven&#8217;t settled down, not surprising given the short time the discipline has been around.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an opportunity for Mozilla to be the first big open-source tech company to deeply bake design DNA into the process. Gary (CEO) has been exalting us to to produce a kick-ass product. UX and UR are a source of innovation. Further, prioritizing around user needs is essential to making an excellent product.</p>
<p><a href="/skinny/content/uploads/2011/11/Tesla-Roadster-Sport-Tesla-Motors-to-Open-Colorado-Gallery-Rear-Angle.jpg"><img title="Tesla-Roadster-Sport-Tesla-Motors-to-Open-Colorado-Gallery-Rear-Angle" src="/skinny/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Tesla-Roadster-Sport-Tesla-Motors-to-Open-Colorado-Gallery-Rear-Angle-600x337.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></a></p>
<p>One bit I didn&#8217;t expect in my survey was that the Chief of Design is a well-established role in car companies. Tesla, BMW, Volvo&#8230; they all have one. It&#8217;s curious to me because car manufacturers are entrenched in technical, mechanical requirements as well. Seems as though they&#8217;ve figured out that it takes more than the feature list and specifications to sell cars to people.</p>
<h3>Get to the point</h3>
<ol>
<li>UX is an objective discipline, not something based on feelings about which shade of blue is prettier.</li>
<li>It should be an organizational priority that blocks projects from launching in the same way the infrasec does.</li>
<li>UX is vital part of every project. We shouldn&#8217;t DO a project unless a trained interaction designer can ensure user needs are met. Until UX is included from the very beginning, before requirements are written, it will be chasing after product and engineering.</li>
</ol>
<h3>So what do we DO?</h3>
<ol>
<li>We need someone with an interaction design background at the c-level and/or steering committee.</li>
<li>Hire UX at a sane number. The ratio in my group is 30:1. It should be around 4:1.</li>
<li>Until we can do that, hire contractors to pick up the slack.</li>
</ol>

<p>===== UPDATE 12/6/2012 =====</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the end of the year. Time for a progress report. Just a few months after I wrote this we reorganized user experience designers and researchers into their own functional team. I was immensely happy for one of our own, Jinghua Zhang, to be promoted as Director of User Experience. In our org chart, that makes her a level 5. VP and C-levels are as high as it goes at level 6. I&#8217;m very proud to see Mozilla&#8217;s progress this year. Onward!</p>

<p>Firefox joined Safari in supporting hyphenation.

<p>Words need to be hyphenated because paragraphs need to be justified. But do you know why most justified texts aren’t very readable even though it looks visually pleasing at a glance? It’s not because they’re justified. It’s because they’re not justified carefully.</p>
<p>Mental exercise: why is the documents you’ve justified in MS Word so hard to read compared to a book? Justified text in books looks great because a lot of things have been adjusted:</p>
<ol>
<li>Margin kerning. E.g. hanging punctuation.
</li>
<li>Character kerning. Ie. letter-spacing needs to be made tighter or looser to make the appearance more even to the eye. <a href="http://texblog.net/png/blindtext.png"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
</li>
<li>Additional kerning for specific characters. E.g. when typesetting French, you’d need to add a word space before (:) and after («»), and a thin space before (?), (!) and (;). <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/punc.htm"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
</li>
<li>Word-spacing. You can’t rely on spacing that’s mechanically widened to fit the paragraph width.
</li>
<li>Ligatures. Ie. when you letterspace loosely, ligatures should be turned off.</li>
</ol>
<p>Justified text in a word processor doesn’t look pleasing because, well, the application doesn’t come with most of these settings.</p>
<p>But how far ahead (or behind) are web browsers in this department? All browsers have a setting to tweak word and letter-spacing (though not finely), and turn ligatures on and off (different browsers, different syntaxes). <a href="http://marc.baffl.co.uk/browser_bugs/css-ligatures.html"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Problem is, you’d need to adjust everything manually.</p>
<p>Firefox does allows for fine control of letterspacing, although it&#8217;s the only browser that does. Here&#8217;s a great discussion of this still frustrating topic on the <a href="http://treehouseagency.com/blog/tim-cosgrove/2011/01/22/putting-letter-spacing-under-microscope">Treehouse Agency blog</a>.</p>
<p>Sure, everything I’ve just described kind of returned us back at square one. But this isn’t to say that justified text isn’t appropriate to use on the web. Here’s how you can start today:</p>
<p>Many of us have control over words on the webpage, even as designers and developers. We can add, remove or change words around to make the word-spacing more even. If not, we have the capability to ask the copywriter sitting in the next room if this nicely-fitted wording still conveys the meaning just as well as the last version.</p>
<p>Since doing this to every paragraph isn’t practical, you might want to limit the use of justified spacing to shorter bodies of text that are easier to control in terms of wording. Longer subheads and introductory paragraphs are perfect.</p>
