				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today is my one-third life birthday. I&#8217;m 33 and 1/3 years old. I have a lot of great stories from this first chunk. So what&#8217;s next?</p>
<p>Have you seen the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHlTvE-AI3Q" title="The Mystery of Picasso : YouTube" target="_blank">documentary</a> where Picasso paints from the other side of a glass? It&#8217;s a national treasure of Spain and for good reason. It&#8217;s simply him working. Hypnotically, he paints and paints and paints. Even once the piece looks &#8220;done&#8221; he reworks the same spot over and over again. Paints over the old marks. Grabs a new canvas and starts again now that he knows &#8220;what he&#8217;s doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>But this isn&#8217;t about Picasso, this is about me. What am I trying to say here? Life is weird. It took a big left turn for me in the way of a broken engagement. My worldly possessions are once again in a storage locker. I have no permanent address. I wouldn&#8217;t say I&#8217;m starting over entirely, but I am scraping some big sections of the canvas that looked like they were finished. </p>
<p>My next piece will be Cambodia.</p>
<p><a href="/skinny/content/uploads/2013/08/phnom-penh-facade.jpg"><img src="/skinny/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/phnom-penh-facade-600x405.jpg" alt="License Attribution Noncommercial Share Alike Some rights reserved by Jonas Hansel " width="600" height="405" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1071" /></a><span style="font-size: 9px;">Some rights reserved by <a title="original photo at flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonashansel/8300113687">Jonas Hansel</a></span></p>
<p>But I should back up. Did I tell you how many incredible, incredible people are around me? People I can go to in moments of raw, thick, embarassing(!) existential crisis? I didn&#8217;t? Oh, so one of them is <a href="http://theheretic.me/" title="The Heretic | Pascal Finette" target="_blank">Pascal Finette</a>, Director of the Office of the Chair at Mozilla. He kicks my ass when I need it. (True story, he was a drill sergeant in the German air force.) I told him it&#8217;d been four years since my last vision quest where I walked the earth and got some perspective. I told him I needed a recharge. </p>
<p>Pascal says things that suck all the oxygen out of the air, like &#8220;Where do you want to go? Anywhere in the world you want to go, I can make an introduction.&#8221; You see, Pascal mentors startups at <a href="http://unreasonable.is/" title="Unreasonable Institute" target="_blank">Unreasonable Institute</a> and is the sort of person that just knows everyone. After several seconds of stunned silence, I replied that it wasn&#8217;t as much the where to go as it was what kind of work I wanted to do. So I told him.</p>
<p>Behavior change has been a fascination of mine for many years. The question of &#8220;How do people make decisions?&#8221; is what drove the creation of <a href="/skinny/category/pielabpdx/" title="PieLabPDX">PieLabPDX</a>. Now I&#8217;m moving a level deeper to &#8220;How does a culture evolve?&#8221; No bigs. With this description, Pascal said &#8220;I know just who to introduce you to.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m extraordinarily fortunate to announce I&#8217;ll be spending the last three months of 2013 volunteering for <a href="http://17triggers.com" title="17 Triggers" target="_blank">17 Triggers</a>, a behavior change marketing agency in Phnom Penh. They work with development organizations like UNICEF and USAID on educational projects that range from agriculture, financial literacy to family planning.</p>
<p>From the intro call with Mike Rios, a founder of 17 Triggers, it was (forgive me) love at first sight. I didn&#8217;t talk to any other organizations. I didn&#8217;t need to. Mike&#8217;s enthusiasm and heart won me immediately. If you watch this talks at TEDx Phnom Penh about his quarter-life crisis that lead to the creation of 17 Triggers, I think you&#8217;ll see the same spark in him that led me to book a one-way ticket to the other side of the world.</p>

<p>My phenomenal team at Mozilla has supported my desire to take some extended leave from the moment I mentioned it. Thanks so much to all my big-hearted colleagues. I am honored to know and work with them all. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3</p>
<p>Whatever you do, just don&#8217;t call this a mid-life crisis. I plan on having one of those in a few years.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Since we got some noms.in press lately with kinds words about the design, Ryan Snyder asked me to write up a few words about some of my design decisions. My first reaction is, there&#8217;s nothing to the design. I didn&#8217;t do much. I just kept it clean and let the images speak for themselves. But, I realize this is selling myself a little short. I&#8217;ve been doing design for a decade now so doing this design felt pretty effortless, but that doesn&#8217;t mean things I take for granted are obvious. I kept all the edges square. There are no gradients, no drop shadows. It&#8217;s flat white with black text. Plain, plain, plain, just the way I like it. The links are a yummy paprika red mostly because I&#8217;m just sick to death of all this lime and turquoise smeared across everything web 2.0. I get irrationally upset about colors. A giant part of the feel of the site is from the full screen background images. Each city has their own background. These are very important, so I hand pick each one.

<p>Since we got some <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2011/05/15/12-seriously-tasty-apps-for-foodies/">noms.in press</a> lately with kinds words about the design, Ryan Snyder asked me to write up a few words about some of my design decisions. My first reaction is, there&#8217;s nothing to the design. I didn&#8217;t do much. I just kept it clean and let the images speak for themselves. But, I realize this is selling myself a little short. I&#8217;ve been doing design for a decade now so doing this design felt pretty effortless, but that doesn&#8217;t mean things I take for granted are obvious.</p>
<p>I kept all the edges square. There are no gradients, no drop shadows. It&#8217;s flat white with black text. Plain, plain, plain, just the way I like it. The links are a yummy paprika red mostly because I&#8217;m just sick to death of all this lime and turquoise smeared across everything web 2.0. I get irrationally upset about colors.</p>
<p>A giant part of the feel of the site is from the full screen background images. Each city has their own background. These are very important, so I hand pick each one. It&#8217;s a bit of a challenge to find the right image because the whole center of the image is obscured by the center column. This knocks out 97% of pictures since most photographers put the interesting bit in the middle of the frame. </p>
<p>The other criteria is that the picture needs to be one that only could&#8217;ve been taken in that city. There are tons of beautiful shots of farmer&#8217;s markets, but they mostly look the same from one city from the next. I shy away from most skylines because, although distinctive, they feel opposite of what noms.in is all about. It&#8217;s not about the whole, all-encompassing picture, it&#8217;s the nooks and crannies that we cherish.</p>
<p>I overlaid a 1px repeating gray square over the whole background. This serves two purposes. First, it helps to unify the look of the site from one city to the next. Even though it&#8217;s a wholly different image, the dot pattern adds a ton of consistency. It also helps to soften back the image so that it recedes and the content can shine forward.</p>
<p><a href="http://noms.in" target="new"><img src="/skinny/content/uploads/2011/05/noms-in-credit2.jpg" alt="noms in creative commons credit" title="noms-in-credit" width="410" height="158" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-405" /></a></p>
<p>The last unique bit is that all of our images are sourced from Flickr. We mostly rely on the largess of the internet for fantastic pictures of the spots we feature. Occasionally, there&#8217;s nothing that&#8217;s suitable and we ask a curator to go take some shots. We only use Creative Commons Commercial licensed images and have built the site to automatically add the credits to each page. I work with some pretty slick developers!</p>

For those not familiar, this little project lets you anonymously declare your romantic or platonic crushes via the twitter account @sxswCrush. Plans for new and improved-ness include. 1. Show list of current tweets as they are popping up. 2. Better explanation of what the H-E-double-hockey-sticks this thing is. 3. #isawyou I Saw You is a huge new feature. As I recently learned, the phenomena of leaving i-almost-hit-on-you-but-didnt-have-the-balls missives dates back to the 1800s when they were published in newspapers. Now the bleeding edge of technology will help your bleeding heart find its match. In addition to declaring who you have crushes on, you may also tell us voyeurs about the fleeting eye contact and awkward smile with the cute dorky boy. I love reading that stuff. If you you&#8217;re the dorky boy the tweet is talking about, Yahtzee! We&#8217;ll do some dm&#8217;s and get you two kids hooked up (hopefully, literally.)

		<description><![CDATA[Ryan Snyder and Dietrich Ayala, both devs at Mozilla, and I put together a city curation site, noms.in. Basically, the idea is that you&#8217;re in a city, say St. Louis, for a conference or wedding or somesuch. What you really wish is that you had a college buddy that&#8217;s awesome that can show you the magic of the city. Unfortunately, you know no one. Instead of spending a couple days sorting through Yelp, you can get a curated list of the top 6 to 10 spots with us. We&#8217;re featuring the personality of the curator very strongly. Where would a graphic designer that&#8217;s also a rockabilly guitar player in his spare time take you? Or where would a sommelier take you? The site&#8217;s not for everyone. It&#8217;s not a budget travel guide&#8230; where&#8217;s the best three dollar burrito. It&#8217;s not for the pleated khakis Dockers and wrinkled shirt crowd. We have a strong voice.

Ryan and I have worked together on several projects and has truly become a close friend *sniffle*. He was absolutely essential in building this cruncher of iPhone app icons.

<h4 style="clear:left;">PAF Bocce League</h4>
<p><img src="/skinny/content/uploads/2010/12/bocce_logo_160.png" alt="" style="margin-bottom:25px;" title="bocce_logo_160" width="160" height="181" class="alignright size-full wp-image-249" />I was pleased to serve on the <a href="http://portlandadfed.com">Portland Ad Fed</a> Ambassador Board. I headed up a project to promote awareness of the organization. Some call it BAH-chee, some call it BOH-chay. In any case, the Park Blocks bocce courts are and excellent place to find yourself on a Thursday afternoon after work. I appointed myself &#8220;Commissioner of Bocce&#8221; and brought together creative and tech agencies for a weekly game.</p>
<h4 style="clear:left;">Cheezburger</h4>
<p><img src="/skinny/content/uploads/2010/12/happy_cat1.jpg" alt="" title="Cheezburger Happy Cat" width="128" height="133" style="margin-bottom:25px;" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-257" />I got a job in April! I took on a position as a full-time contractor doing UX and front-end web dev for the largest network of humor and entertainment sites, Cheezburger! They&#8217;re best known for <a href="http://failblog.org">failblog.org</a> and <a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com">icanhascheezburger.com</a> and keep me busy and LOLzing.</p>

<p><a href="/skinny/content/uploads/2010/12/wweek_pielab-lg.jpg"><img src="/skinny/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/wweek_pielab-lg-410x273.jpg" alt="" title="Willamette Week PieLabPDX" width="410" height="273" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-268" /></a><br />
You can read about all the <a href="/skinny/category/pielabpdx/">shenanigans</a> right here on this little blog. In short, I put up a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1673171669/pielab-a-game-laboratory-food-cart-by-skinny">Kickstarter project</a> and successfully funded a behavioral experiment masquerading as a pop-up pie cart. I was in the <a href="http://wweek.com/editorial/3643/14449/">Willamette Week</a> and on KGW news. I had <a href="http://yfrog.com/6p44pz">crazy lines</a> around the block. I sold out every day but one. MADNESS!</p>
