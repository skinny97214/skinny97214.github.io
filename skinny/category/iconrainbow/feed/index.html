It&#8217;s been a year. What do I have to show for myself? For one, a little site called <a href="http://iconrainbow.com">IconRainbow</a> I made with the patient assistance of Ryan Snyder, aka <a href="http://twitter.com/ryansnyder">@ryansnyder</a>. It&#8217;s all about the purdy colors, specifically colors of icons pulled from the iPhone app store.</p>
<h3>Why color?</h3>
<p>If you are a designer, I would tell you that it&#8217;s eye candy; a place for designers to come find inspiration. </p>
<p>If you were a dev, I would tell you that it&#8217;s a different sort data visualization of the iPhone store; a way to take in several hundred apps at a glance.</p>
<p>If you were an investor, I would tell you that the big picture is to aggregate color information from all over the web and analyze that data to determine trends; that the iPhone store is only our first data set.</p>
<h3>Why the iPhone app store?</h3>
<p>Well, for several reasons, most importantly because there is a built-in quality filter. There&#8217;s a higher bar in terms of complexity and therefore expense to get an app accepted. Also because companies have been given a very well defined task of expressing their brand in that little square of pixels. They&#8217;re forced to simplify the essence of their graphic identity down into one thing. Lastly, nice little squares are all the same size which means I can show a whole bunch of them in a neat grid. This makes me happy.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s next?</h3>
<p>Right now, we only have a subset of about 5,000 icons. That got us up and running, but now it&#8217;s time to get all the data. Ryan is writing a scraper to pull down the entire store with more of the meta data (text of the app descriptions, a link to see the app in the official store, etc.) We&#8217;ll be adding search so you can narrow down which sort of icons you want to see in a more granular way than just categories. </p>
<p>The big monster is the trend data. That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about. We&#8217;ll need to collect data on the whole store for three months and then we&#8217;ll be rolling out an entirely new home page focused on those trends.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it! I&#8217;m doing user interviews to help shape what the new features, especially the home page, will be. Give me a shout on twitter if you&#8217;d like to be a part.</p>
