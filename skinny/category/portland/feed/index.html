				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I visited <a title="ziba industrial design agency" href="http://ziba.com">Ziba</a> on a sunny, crisp fall day. (Yes, we do have them at least once a decade here in Portland.) One of their talented creative directors, Kai Halsinger, was generous enough to show me around the studio and talk about what makes it all work. Specifically on my mind was how their physical space influence the work they do. This building was carefully considered to support their creative process.</p>
<p>A little background for those unfamiliar: Ziba is an experience design firm here in Portland. If you&#8217;ve seen a recent Wacom tablet or the beautifully high-low TDK boombox, you&#8217;ve appreciated their <a href="http://www.ziba.com/#/work/">work</a>.</p>
<p>Two things stood out to me about their offices.</p>
<p><a href="/skinny/content/uploads/2011/11/ziba-names.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-642" title="ziba-names" src="/skinny/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/ziba-names-600x414.jpg" alt="ziba emphasis on individual contributors" width="600" height="414" /></a></p>
<h3>Emphasis on the individual contributor</h3>
<p>Yes, the giant roboman is awesome, but look across. Right when you walk in the lobby, the wall behind reception is covered in the names of the employees. It might seem like a small thing, that is unless you are one of the names on the wall. The list contains the current employees in chronological order of when they started to work for Ziba. The talent is really all information/innovation companies are. This might not resonate as much in non-Westerners where the highest good is to be part of a whole, but from this little girl from Arkansas, much respect.</p>
<p><a href="/skinny/content/uploads/2011/11/ziba-project-rooms.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-637" title="ziba-project-room" src="/skinny/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/ziba-project-rooms-600x440.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<h3>Project rooms</h3>
<p>The desks at Ziba are kept deliberately small. There are no cubes. The desks are arranged into long rows. Funny thing was, almost no one was at their desk. Kai said and observation confirmed, folks spend the majority of their time inside project rooms. The uninitiated might assume it was merely a conference room where no one had bothered to clean all the stuff off the walls.</p>
<p>This space was organized around the core idea that the best, most creative work is done when you get people out from behind their desks into a big room. Squeezed together around a big table, people can cheat off their neighbor&#8217;s test paper, or as we call it in the professional world, cross-pollination. As they develop concepts, mockups are printed out and pinned around the room. They have giant format plotters for printing oversize documents. There are post-its from various brainstorming methodologies confettied across the walls. Whiteboards are covered in elegant scrawls.</p>
<p>Because the room is dedicated to a client, you never have to clear off the walls to make room for someone else. The cruft can accumulate. The importance of this not obvious at first, but is key to the creative process. You have to absorb the idea or form for at least a few days. The most important benefit of the project rooms is to never lose ideas &#8211; pin them up &#8211; and then to be able to connect previously disjointed thoughts or see new patterns that spark further ideas. This space allows time for designs to live and breathe so you can properly figure out what is working. You&#8217;ll walk in one morning and it&#8217;ll be obvious what to do next. This can&#8217;t be rushed.</p>
<p>Ziba generally keeps one project room per client. There may be more than one project in the room at a time. It&#8217;s a big benefit to keep the design languages consistent as each takes shape.</p>
<p>I also spoke to <a title="twitter - Bill DeRouchey" href="https://twitter.com/#!/billder">Bill DeRouchey</a>, former Interim Director when this building was brand new. He was in their previous space as well. The project rooms there had been retrofitted into the existing footprint, not as perfectly. He said they didn&#8217;t have enough for all of the work to go in project rooms, so mockups, notes, cruft flowed out into the halls. Some of the best insights were from someone not assigned to that client randomly walking by and stopping to take a look. It&#8217;s an open question whether the serendipity from this imperfection is worth more than the clean beauty and efficiency of the current space.</p>
<p>Kai said clients make great effort and take great pleasure in coming to work in &#8220;their&#8221; project rooms with the creative teams. I asked how they extended the experience when clients aren&#8217;t able to travel on a regular basis. Not surprisingly, they&#8217;ve cooked up a clever solution. There is a panoramic camera that takes a 360 degree shot so they can pan and zoom around and see how things are morphing.</p>
<p>I hope to steal this trick and the project room concept for Mozilla. Project rooms are by no means a shocking new idea for agencies. They&#8217;ve been using them for years. I&#8217;m writing this to bring it to light so that engineering-driven companies who have in-house design groups like Mozilla can steal this idea. Designers&#8217; needs are distinct from developers and not so obvious.</p>
<p>The key bits are</p>
<ul>
<li>expansive whiteboards</li>
<li>pinboards</li>
<li>post-its</li>
<li>a way of printing things out in large format</li>
<li>a large conference table in the middle</li>
<li>a great team that constantly curates the room and evolves the vision</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, Ziba is an inspiring, beautiful place filled with unnecessarily clever (ok, maybe necessarily clever) people. I suspect it&#8217;s a wonderful space to come to every day.</p>

<p>There aren&#8217;t many things more viscerally experienced than a protest. It&#8217;s got all the right components: big crowds, a common purpose you&#8217;re passionate about, defiance of authority and the accompanying tinge of danger.</p>
<p>For me, that danger was foremost in my mind. A funny but serious post went up on the weekly rag, The Portland Mercury, ominously titled <a href="http://blogtown.portlandmercury.com/BlogtownPDX/archives/2011/10/06/read-this-before-you-protest-an-open-letter-to-occupy-portland-from-a-public-defender">Read This Before You Protest: An Open Letter to Occupy Portland from a Public Defender</a> It gave sober advice that being arrested is a real, painful, annoying, costly possibility.

<p>I pondered, &#8220;should I go at all?&#8221; How could I best limit my risk. I am tiny. You many know this already. I am 5&#8217;2&#8243; and people don&#8217;t believe me when I say I weigh more than 100lbs. (I do.)</p>
<p>Possibility #1: Put on my sturdiest boots, a nice brown hiking pair. Look tough. Grrrrrrr. Could I get my hands on a bullet-proof vest on short notice? These are thoughts in my head.</p>
<p>Possibility #2: I am vulnerable. Go with it 100 percent. Put on my bright pink scarf and lipstick. Walk out of the house exactly as I would on any other day. My theory being that looking entirely the opposite of the stereotype male hooligan in black shitkickers would mean that even if I did get in a tight spot, I&#8217;d be most likely to have someone protect me. My exaggerated femininity would be my shield. Let&#8217;s be honest, I might need someone to scoop me up from danger, whether it be BY a cop or FROM one.</p>
<p>I decided that I was actually safer by looking more vulnerable. When faced with something that you&#8217;d rather hide, you can either hide it really well or you can play it up even bigger. So yeah, I went with option two. Did you even think for a minute that I wouldn&#8217;t? That hiding it bit rarely works out well anyway.</p>
<p>Fight to be authentic. Your strength lies there.</p>
<p>The reality was there were no arrests in the crowd of 10,000. It&#8217;s Portland. We&#8217;re so polite we sat down on the ground when they asked so that everyone could see and hear. I hope as the protest continues through the night in Chapman and Lownsdale squares as peacefully as when I left it.</p>
<p>“First they ignore you,<br />
then they laugh at you,<br />
then they fight you,<br />
then you win.”</p>

<p><em>Crowds continue to fascinate me. If you&#8217;re interested in a scholarly tome on the issue, I can&#8217;t recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Crowds-Power-Elias-Canetti/dp/0374518203">Elias Canneti&#8217;s Crowds and Power</a> highly enough.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/skinny/content/uploads/2010/10/chalkboard.jpg"><img src="/skinny/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/chalkboard-600x450.jpg" alt="" title="chalkboard" width="600" height="450" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-199" /></a></p>
<p>The past three weeks I&#8217;ve been playing some variation on letting people pay whatever they want to. The first week I told customers they could pay me however much they thought it was worth. I removed the tip jar and put a question mark on the menu board in the place of the price. Many folks asked how much it usually cost and I told them I wasn&#8217;t allowed to tell. I recorded how much they paid by chalking up tally marks next the prices per slice 3, 4, 5, 6 &#8230; I was surprised that I had to add 7, 8 and 9. Although I did have a few outliers in those high and low, most people handed me a $5 bill and didn&#8217;t ask for change back.</p>
<p>The next week I also let people pay however much they would like, but this time it was a secret to me. I had them take a fresh envelope out of the box and enclose their payment. This time they could truly pay whatever they wanted without the social pressure of me staring them in the eye. If they needed change they could hand me the large bill and I would break it so I still wouldn&#8217;t know how much they were contributing. The full envelope went into the second box and they went on their merry way. After the service was over I took the box back and tallied the amount in each one. My mistake was that I didn&#8217;t have the customers write how many slices they were paying for. If an envelope had six dollars, is that for one slice or two? I do know that I made the same number of servings from this week to the last. Unfortunately, the data for this weeks is not as solid as the previous week.</p>
<p>The third week I repeated the same envelope experiment. This time I had customers report the number of slices on the outside of the envelope. Also, I explained to each person that all proceeds of the cart for this day would benefit The <a href="http://nationalmall.org">Trust for the National Mall</a> in Washington, DC. I wanted to see if this would raise the median amount per person.</p>
<p>Why this nonprofit? It is the recommended charity for the <a href="http://rallytorestoresanity.com">Rally to Restore Sanity</a> coming up in two weeks which I am lucky enough to be attending. It seemed like a good choice because it is a politically neutral charity that presumably is acceptable to a large majority of people. </p>
<p>Side note: The two weeks of envelope experiments had a super wonderful side effect of me not touching the money very much. I only needed to break bills for a handful of folks. This allowed me to not have to switch back and forth between needing clean hands to cut pie and then handling money. I could ditch the plastic gloves. Yay! It also dramatically speeded the transaction, definitely a good thing since I&#8217;ve had mad long lines lately.</p>
<p>Results, already! </p>

<p>For those of you who aren&#8217;t familiar with the story, that&#8217;s the original idea that inspired the cart. In this experiment, customers get the order of the person in line ahead of them. Whatever they order goes to the lucky one to come after them, creating a chain of connected people. </p>
<p>I finally mustered the courage to play Pie It Forward. I was nervous to play because I was taking all control over which pie flavor the customer would receive. This wasn&#8217;t an optional game. The customer could either take the risk or walk away. A common question was &#8220;What flavor did they pick for me?&#8221; I wouldn&#8217;t tell. They had to agree to play before I would reveal their fate. </p>
<p>I was interested in finding out why people ordered what they did for the person to follow. The overwhelming majority chose a flavor they they found superior and they believed the next person would enjoy. One lady was from England and chose rhubarb for the customer behind her because she thought it was an under appreciated flavor here. Conversely, one guy wasn&#8217;t pleased that he received cherry. He chose cherry for the next person because &#8220;that&#8217;s what happened to me.&#8221; Heehee.</p>
<p>Only one person out of about forty walked away. He walked up and I described the game to him. His reaction &#8220;No. No, I don&#8217;t think so.&#8221; and wandered away. He wasn&#8217;t mean or angry, just politely declined.</p>
<p>Small groups of friends come together to have a little pie break. In these cases, they always elected someone who would take the risk of receiving the mystery pie flavor. Then the rest of them would get what they wanted. I believe the game aspect encourages people to come with friends.</p>
<p>I encouraged conversation between the folks in line, saying things like &#8220;you better make this guy right ahead of you your new best friend. He&#8217;s going to be the one choosing which flavor you get.&#8221; This generally worked well. There&#8217;s a cheerful mood around the pie cart, as you can imagine. Often times customers would hang around the cart and chat, which is a great dynamic to have. </p>
<p>I had fun. The customers (generally) had fun. I sold out in 2 1/2 hours. I declared it a success.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_143" style="width: 420px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="/skinny/content/uploads/2010/09/wheel_of_fortune-410x394.jpg" alt="wheel of fortune" title="wheel_of_fortune" width="410" height="394" class="size-medium wp-image-143" /><p class="wp-caption-text">wheel of fortune</p></div>
<p>The beautiful wheel of fortune was installed on the cart two weeks ago and I&#8217;ve been putting it to use ever since. It has a chalkboard finish, so I can change the options and relative probability of each. There are approximately fifty spaces with one special half size space. Its pegs are painted red and there is always a super charged prize or woe. The chance of landing on it is about 1 in 100. These first two weeks the special space held a free slice of pie. So far I&#8217;ve given away a free slice to one lucky guy.</p>
<p>For the last two weeks, I&#8217;ve been using the wheel to list pie flavors. Each week, there has been a flavor that is more limited in quantity. I assign it fewer spaces so it won&#8217;t run out too soon. Once the pie flavors start running short, the game becomes less fun so I want to extend those as long as possible.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, I gave customers the option to spin the wheel or, if they knew what they wanted, choose the flavor. This is an optional game. People didn&#8217;t have to spin unless they wanted to and the only real incentive was the special free space. 34% spun the wheel.</p>
<p>Last week, I gave them the same option to spin or choose, but this time there was a $1.00 discount if you spun the wheel. This time 50% spun. </p>
<p><img src="/skinny/content/uploads/2010/09/spin_vs_choose.gif" alt="spin_vs_choose" title="spin_vs_choose" width="410" height="435" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146" /></p>
<p>These experiments need to be repeated to get a larger sample size, but early results are that most of the people who are spinning are doing so simply for the fun of it. Financial incentives certainly do sway the number of people who will take a chance but I expected the bump to be more than 15%. </p>
<p>I also tracked whether the folks who chose did so because they wanted a certain flavor or to avoid an unpleasant choice. 76% were choosing to choose instead of spin because they knew what they wanted. </p>
<p>Many people have suggested that I provide a bad flavor to see how that changes things. I think this is a valid point, but I don&#8217;t know exactly how to implement. What one person sees as a bad flavor (see rhubarb, gooseberry) is the next guy&#8217;s favorite. I&#8217;m mulling it over, but it is against my cooking sensibilities to make something truly awful like earwax flavor.</p>

<p>The first day, delayed though it was, went off without a hitch. I met the City of Portland inspector at 11pm and he issued me my sidewalk permit without further hassle. Whew. </p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t been blogging much because the large part of what I&#8217;ve been learning is about the intricacies of Portland zoning, permitting, and food safety. I&#8217;ll summarize to say that I&#8217;m finally done paying for permits and the total bill is just slightly under $1100. Those permits are calendar year and NOT prorated. So that huge sum is good for four months. It appears that prorating the first year is just too much math for our good government officials. I commiserated with other cart owners who had no pity on me, saying that they have eleven permits to my four so suck it up. First lesson, starting a cart is more expensive than you think.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<p><em>Cutting and serving pie is sticky business</em>. I need gloves. If I&#8217;m going to record tallies of game play with a pen and paper, I need to be able to quickly go from sticky hands to clean hands. The devil is in the details, you know.</p>
<p><em>I need to make more pie</em>. I wanted to ramp up gently, so Friday I made four pies and a double cobbler, roughly 45 servings. I sold out in two hours. TWO HOURS! There were lines of a dozen folks at a couple of points throughout the afternoon. </p>
<p><em>People loves some piez.</em> A lady with a dog walked around the corner and exclaimed &#8220;Oh my god, is that pie?!?&#8221; There were many groups of people that had a major rubberneck as they walked by. The mailman looked longingly and then came back later. Really, it was quite comical. Also, people are very likely to chat it up. I think pie has a nostalgic emotional connection. I don&#8217;t think I could&#8217;ve picked a better item as lure for my social experiments.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, the first game was Rock Paper Scissors. I was amazed to find that <em>not everyone remembers exactly how to play</em>. I picked it because I wanted to do something very light weight that everyone would relate to. I was right that everyone seems to have played it at one point, but I did have to give a little refresher to a handful. </p>
<p>I also learned that I<em>&#8216;m a force to be reckoned with at Rock Paper Scissors</em>. Even though I was actively trying to lose, I won about 70% of the time. (I&#8217;ll track such stats more precisely in the future. See note about sticky fingers.)</p>
<p>Conversely, <em>I&#8217;m a total softy</em>. If someone had already told me what they wanted, inadvertently or not, I gave them what they wanted even if I won. In cases where there was a group of people in line, I encouraged them to engineer a trade. I&#8217;m looking forward to games with the wheel where my agency isn&#8217;t required or allowed.</p>
<p>When people won (returning them to the state at which you normally find yourself when ordering at a cart, namely, being able to pick what you get) they were extremely excited. It brought out a childlike happiness for many. Remember that mailman? It was bizarre and wonderful to ask him to Rock Paper Scissors with me. </p>
<p>It was pretty hilarious that just putting something at stake, essentially a wager, meant there was a <em>palpable thrill of the kill</em>. I was reminded of how much more fun blackjack and poker are when you&#8217;re betting real money. Without the wager, they&#8217;re pretty dull actually. The biggest adrenaline was when there was a line of people who&#8217;d been defeated by my skills. If three people in a row went down, the fourth customer to step up felt like they were coming up against a pitcher on a no-hit streak. When they won, it was pure joy.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait for next week! The custom crafted wheel of fortune has been attached. Much fun and mischief will ensue.</p>

<p>Let me give you an example of one game that we&#8217;ll play that actually was the inspiration for it all. It came from a blog post written by Cabel Sasser of Panic about a Mystery Cafe that he stumbled upon in Japan. It works like this.

The person who comes after them will get what they ordered. It&#8217;s a big chain. You can elect to set the person after you for a sweet treat.</p>
<p>Back to the pie: the cart will serve beautiful slices of homemade pies. The flavors will be mostly tried and true recipes from my granny but there will be the occasional gourmand flavor like Momofuku&#8217;s chocolate pie that has a cult following in NYC. A la mode? Of course, and there will be an ever-ready pot of fresh coffee at hand.</p>
<p>Again, a giant thanks to all of those who made the <a href="http://bit.ly/pieLabPDX">Kickstarter project</a> a success! We raised $1650 to help cover the costs of the construction, permitting, and insurance. Hugs to all!</p>
<p>I debuted at <a href="http://30hourday.org">30 Hour Day,</a> a livestreaming telathon to benefit the Oregon Food Bank this past Saturday. Have a look at the beautiful pics!</p>

<p>Notes:</p>
<p><strong>Lens Crafters:</strong> Even though I would never use them, I thought it would be good to include them for comparison purposes. </p>
<p><strong>Golden Optical:</strong> First note: They will not sell you only a contact fitting. They <i>only</i> offer a six-month supply. For my simple single-vision lenses this ran $280. Second note: They were recommended to me by one party, thrashed by another. &#8220;I tried Golden Optical. I&#8217;ll never go back. Outdated equipment, bad service, high pressure sales. No, no, no. Before you get your exam they make you sign an agreement stating you will buy you frames and accessories from them. That&#8217;s crazy. I&#8217;d gotten my prescription from them before but when they tried to get me to sign this this form I walked out. When I went to anther optometrist I realized how outdated Golden was. For example, their exam room isn&#8217;t long enough to stand the correct distance from the eye chart so they have you look at a mirror with the chart behind you to double the distance.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>America&#8217;s Best:</strong> So they&#8217;ve got this crazy deal. Your exam is $45, but for $69.95 you get an exam AND TWO pairs of glasses. Crazy! You get two pairs of glasses for only $25 more. They&#8217;re making their money on contact fittings and glasses upgrades. The scratch coating which costs about $4 at online glasses retailers will run you a whopping $69 here.</p>
<p>So who will I go with? I&#8217;m split between Ogle and Blink. They both offer the fancy tenometry test for glaucoma instead of the horrible air-puff machine. I think I&#8217;ll go with Blink because they&#8217;re close to my house, have convenient hours, and are pretty cheap.</p>
<p>My next adventure will be to buy my prescription glasses online. Optometrists are making huge margins on glasses and I&#8217;m not going to help them make their boat payment. I&#8217;m thinking these $16.95 tortoiseshell beauties from <a href="http://www.glassesshop.com/Glasses/071.html">glassesshop.com</a> will do nicely. I&#8217;ll keep you posted.</p>
