				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi, Paul Graham. My name is Crystal and I&#8217;ve been hacking for the past 29 years. I don&#8217;t know how you intended your comments but oh lordy, the internet has had a fun time speculating. I&#8217;ll leave that commentary to others but I do want to say I&#8217;m happy you brought up this debate about gender disparity in tech, as it has sparked some excellent conversation about how we&#8217;re going to fix it.</p>
<p>I believe we will fix it in part by having role models. In that spirit, I offer my own nerd story.</p>
<p>I was a poor kid from Arkansas eating government cheese, raised by my grandmother. I didn&#8217;t know I was poor. For Christmas 1984, I asked for a computer. Santa brought me a navy and yellow toy computer called a Whiz Kid. I was disappointed. I meant a real computer.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1102" alt="VTech Whiz Kid" src="http://personandplace.s3.amazonaws.com/4whiz-600x366.jpg" width="600" height="366" /></p>
<p>When I was in middle school, I went to a nerd summer camp called &#8220;Artificial Intelligence&#8221; in 1991 at Harding University. It was my first taste of programming. The language? LISP. Their comp sci department had VAX mainframes to tinker around with Pine email, send the other campers chat messages and use telnet to play text adventure games. My username was Cleopatra on Medievia.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1103" alt="medievia" src="http://personandplace.s3.amazonaws.com/medievia-600x255.png" width="600" height="255" /></p>
<p>When I was twelve, I saved up $500 and bought an 8088 computer. Remember the 386/486 and the Pentium? This was the one before it. I had enough money to spring for the optional 20MB hard drive, a wise investment. I needed that to save all the images I was about to create with Paint and to play Wolfenstein 3D, Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego and QBasic Gorillas. It was on that computer I learned the universal hardware repair rule that you don&#8217;t put the case on and screw in all the tiny screws until you&#8217;re absolutely sure the new power supply is working.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1104" alt="QBasic Gorillas Throwing Bananas" src="http://personandplace.s3.amazonaws.com/Gorillas_screenshot1-600x328.png" width="600" height="328" /></p>
<p>At fourteen I was programming my TI-85 to graph equations and check my algebra solutions. It&#8217;s not clear if it was cheating. I suspect the teachers knew I was going to make the highest grade on the math test regardless.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-1106 aligncenter" alt="ti85" src="http://personandplace.s3.amazonaws.com/ti85.gif" width="288" height="144" /></p>
<p>At seventeen, I had a perfect score, 36, on the science part of the ACT and a 33 in math which qualified me for a generous scholarship. Arkansas doesn&#8217;t have an early graduation provision, so I dropped out of high school, took my GED and enrolled in university a whole year early. I majored in computer science. I later added a major in fine art and moved comp sci to be my minor. The natural intersection of design and programming seemed to be web design, which is the field I&#8217;m still in.</p>
<p>This career has given me enormous opportunities. I&#8217;m typing this from Phnom Penh, <a title="My 1/3-Life Crisis" href="/skinny/my-one-third-life-crisis/1058/">Cambodia</a> where I&#8217;ve come to volunteer my professional skills to help good causes in developing countries. I travel around the world pushing the web forward as a Product Designer at Mozilla. Before that I was a LOLcat herder for I Can Has Cheezburger. I&#8217;ve spoken at conferences in Barcelona, New York and of course, my home in Portland, Oregon. I love the flexibility and creativity of my career, and I&#8217;m incredibly fortunate and grateful to live this life.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://personandplace.s3.amazonaws.com/h4AAFB38C.jpg" width="500" height="500" /></p>
<p>So what now? If you&#8217;re a man, please share this on the social media platform of your choice. <a title="On Twitter, Men Are Retweeted Far More Than Women" href="http://www.mediabistro.com/alltwitter/twee-q-sexist-twitter_b26170" target="_blank">Women are half as likely to be retweeted as men.</a> Want to do more? Ask a woman you admire to tell her story. If you&#8217;re a woman, write up your nerd origins and share it with the hashtag #mynerdstory. The 13-year-olds of today need role models from every racial, ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. The adult women need role models, like <a title="Fuck Pattern Recognition" href="https://medium.com/p/8178b279430f">Melinda Byerley who learned HTML and CSS at 42</a> so she could hack on her startup&#8217;s website. We need to hear your story, too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today is my one-third life birthday. I&#8217;m 33 and 1/3 years old. I have a lot of great stories from this first chunk. So what&#8217;s next?</p>
<p>Have you seen the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHlTvE-AI3Q" title="The Mystery of Picasso : YouTube" target="_blank">documentary</a> where Picasso paints from the other side of a glass? It&#8217;s a national treasure of Spain and for good reason. It&#8217;s simply him working. Hypnotically, he paints and paints and paints. Even once the piece looks &#8220;done&#8221; he reworks the same spot over and over again. Paints over the old marks. Grabs a new canvas and starts again now that he knows &#8220;what he&#8217;s doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>But this isn&#8217;t about Picasso, this is about me. What am I trying to say here? Life is weird. It took a big left turn for me in the way of a broken engagement. My worldly possessions are once again in a storage locker. I have no permanent address. I wouldn&#8217;t say I&#8217;m starting over entirely, but I am scraping some big sections of the canvas that looked like they were finished. </p>
<p>My next piece will be Cambodia.</p>
<p><a href="/skinny/content/uploads/2013/08/phnom-penh-facade.jpg"><img src="/skinny/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/phnom-penh-facade-600x405.jpg" alt="License Attribution Noncommercial Share Alike Some rights reserved by Jonas Hansel " width="600" height="405" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1071" /></a><span style="font-size: 9px;">Some rights reserved by <a title="original photo at flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonashansel/8300113687">Jonas Hansel</a></span></p>
<p>But I should back up. Did I tell you how many incredible, incredible people are around me? People I can go to in moments of raw, thick, embarassing(!) existential crisis? I didn&#8217;t? Oh, so one of them is <a href="http://theheretic.me/" title="The Heretic | Pascal Finette" target="_blank">Pascal Finette</a>, Director of the Office of the Chair at Mozilla. He kicks my ass when I need it. (True story, he was a drill sergeant in the German air force.) I told him it&#8217;d been four years since my last vision quest where I walked the earth and got some perspective. I told him I needed a recharge. </p>
<p>Pascal says things that suck all the oxygen out of the air, like &#8220;Where do you want to go? Anywhere in the world you want to go, I can make an introduction.&#8221; You see, Pascal mentors startups at <a href="http://unreasonable.is/" title="Unreasonable Institute" target="_blank">Unreasonable Institute</a> and is the sort of person that just knows everyone. After several seconds of stunned silence, I replied that it wasn&#8217;t as much the where to go as it was what kind of work I wanted to do. So I told him.</p>
<p>Behavior change has been a fascination of mine for many years. The question of &#8220;How do people make decisions?&#8221; is what drove the creation of <a href="/skinny/category/pielabpdx/" title="PieLabPDX">PieLabPDX</a>. Now I&#8217;m moving a level deeper to &#8220;How does a culture evolve?&#8221; No bigs. With this description, Pascal said &#8220;I know just who to introduce you to.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m extraordinarily fortunate to announce I&#8217;ll be spending the last three months of 2013 volunteering for <a href="http://17triggers.com" title="17 Triggers" target="_blank">17 Triggers</a>, a behavior change marketing agency in Phnom Penh. They work with development organizations like UNICEF and USAID on educational projects that range from agriculture, financial literacy to family planning.</p>
<p>From the intro call with Mike Rios, a founder of 17 Triggers, it was (forgive me) love at first sight. I didn&#8217;t talk to any other organizations. I didn&#8217;t need to. Mike&#8217;s enthusiasm and heart won me immediately. If you watch this talks at TEDx Phnom Penh about his quarter-life crisis that lead to the creation of 17 Triggers, I think you&#8217;ll see the same spark in him that led me to book a one-way ticket to the other side of the world.</p>

<p>My phenomenal team at Mozilla has supported my desire to take some extended leave from the moment I mentioned it. Thanks so much to all my big-hearted colleagues. I am honored to know and work with them all. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3</p>
<p>Whatever you do, just don&#8217;t call this a mid-life crisis. I plan on having one of those in a few years.</p>

<p><a href="/skinny/content/uploads/2011/11/user-business-technical-needs.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-721" title="user needs technical needs business needs" src="/skinny/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/user-business-technical-needs.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="468" /></a></p>
<p>Yes, this is a post about Mozilla, but you can generalize to any open-source software project. At every conference I hear the same refrain, &#8220;Why is design so hard in open source?&#8221; It&#8217;s so hard because *drumroll please* it&#8217;s not made a priority. None of the top decision-makers are designers. Period. The End. You can stop reading.</p>
<p>Without someone in the c-level or steering committee with a design background to speak on users&#8217; behalf, Mozilla is missing out. Engineers and business people see entirely different challenges. Without all sides (technical needs, business needs, user needs), we have a giant blind spot.</p>
<h3>Chief of Experience? Never heard of one.</h3>
<p>If everyone jumped off the bridge, would you do it too? It&#8217;s true, there aren&#8217;t many tech companies, especially open-source ones that have a design representative at the executive level. Google, Microsoft, Opera, Facebook, Intel, Amazon and even Adobe lack it. There are some surprising companies that do. Oracle has a Chief Evangelist of User Experience. Flipboard has a Head of Design. Nokia and Yahoo have a Senior VP of Design. You might&#8217;ve heard of the most notable SVP of Design, Johnny Ive of Apple. You&#8217;ll note titles of this position haven&#8217;t settled down, not surprising given the short time the discipline has been around.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an opportunity for Mozilla to be the first big open-source tech company to deeply bake design DNA into the process. Gary (CEO) has been exalting us to to produce a kick-ass product. UX and UR are a source of innovation. Further, prioritizing around user needs is essential to making an excellent product.</p>
<p><a href="/skinny/content/uploads/2011/11/Tesla-Roadster-Sport-Tesla-Motors-to-Open-Colorado-Gallery-Rear-Angle.jpg"><img title="Tesla-Roadster-Sport-Tesla-Motors-to-Open-Colorado-Gallery-Rear-Angle" src="/skinny/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Tesla-Roadster-Sport-Tesla-Motors-to-Open-Colorado-Gallery-Rear-Angle-600x337.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></a></p>
<p>One bit I didn&#8217;t expect in my survey was that the Chief of Design is a well-established role in car companies. Tesla, BMW, Volvo&#8230; they all have one. It&#8217;s curious to me because car manufacturers are entrenched in technical, mechanical requirements as well. Seems as though they&#8217;ve figured out that it takes more than the feature list and specifications to sell cars to people.</p>
<h3>Get to the point</h3>
<ol>
<li>UX is an objective discipline, not something based on feelings about which shade of blue is prettier.</li>
<li>It should be an organizational priority that blocks projects from launching in the same way the infrasec does.</li>
<li>UX is vital part of every project. We shouldn&#8217;t DO a project unless a trained interaction designer can ensure user needs are met. Until UX is included from the very beginning, before requirements are written, it will be chasing after product and engineering.</li>
</ol>
<h3>So what do we DO?</h3>
<ol>
<li>We need someone with an interaction design background at the c-level and/or steering committee.</li>
<li>Hire UX at a sane number. The ratio in my group is 30:1. It should be around 4:1.</li>
<li>Until we can do that, hire contractors to pick up the slack.</li>
</ol>

<p>===== UPDATE 12/6/2012 =====</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the end of the year. Time for a progress report. Just a few months after I wrote this we reorganized user experience designers and researchers into their own functional team. I was immensely happy for one of our own, Jinghua Zhang, to be promoted as Director of User Experience. In our org chart, that makes her a level 5. VP and C-levels are as high as it goes at level 6. I&#8217;m very proud to see Mozilla&#8217;s progress this year. Onward!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since I&#8217;ve had a few inquiries, I&#8217;m officially putting up my twitter username, <a href="http://twitter.com/skinny">@skinny</a>, up for sale. It&#8217;s a certified, one-owner name in like-new condition. The first $25,000 cashier check or cash takes it.</p>

I headed up a project to promote awareness of the organization. Some call it BAH-chee, some call it BOH-chay. In any case, the Park Blocks bocce courts are and excellent place to find yourself on a Thursday afternoon after work. I appointed myself &#8220;Commissioner of Bocce&#8221; and brought together creative and tech agencies for a weekly game.</p>

I took on a position as a full-time contractor doing UX and front-end web dev for the largest network of humor and entertainment sites, Cheezburger! They&#8217;re best known for <a href="http://failblog.org">failblog.org</a> and <a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com">icanhascheezburger.com</a> and keep me busy and LOLzing.</p>

You can read about all the <a href="/skinny/category/pielabpdx/">shenanigans</a> right here on this little blog. In short, I put up a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1673171669/pielab-a-game-laboratory-food-cart-by-skinny">Kickstarter project</a> and successfully funded a behavioral experiment masquerading as a pop-up pie cart. I was in the <a href="http://wweek.com/editorial/3643/14449/">Willamette Week</a> and on KGW news. I had <a href="http://yfrog.com/6p44pz">crazy lines</a> around the block. I sold out every day but one. MADNESS!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I was reading the article by Clay Shirky this morning and it lit a fire under me. The post, titled A Rant About Women, in short says that when women fail it&#8217;s often not because of lack of talent, ambition or intelligence but an unwillingness to be &#8220;arrogant self-aggrandizing jerks.&#8221; He was irritated to see more men than women succeed in his program at NYU ITP despite similar ability. I&#8217;ll leave it to you to read the whole post. It&#8217;s well worth the time. I have my moments when I summon the balls to be the bitch the situation deserves. One of those was at SXSWi last March. I was having a Frito pie at a sports bar with the CTO of Cheezburger Networks, Scott Porad. We had met at SXSWi in 2009 and were catching up on the year&#8217;s accomplishments. He was telling me about which positions they were looking to hire to see if I knew anyone. One of those particularly difficult to fill was a designer that could code. (Me!) Great! But he phrased it in such a way that it made it sound like he didn&#8217;t think I was qualified.

<p>I was reading the article by Clay Shirky this morning and it lit a fire under me.

<p>I have my moments when I summon the balls to be the bitch the situation deserves. One of those was at SXSWi last March. I was having a Frito pie at a sports bar with the CTO of <a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com">Cheezburger Networks</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/scottporad">Scott Porad</a>. We had met at SXSWi in 2009 and were catching up on the year&#8217;s accomplishments. He was telling me about which positions they were looking to hire to see if I knew anyone. One of those particularly difficult to fill was a designer that could code. (Me!) Great! But he phrased it in such a way that it made it sound like he didn&#8217;t think I was qualified.</p>
<p>I sat and munched on my fritos and fretted a bit. What was wrong with me? What had I done wrong? Maybe I&#8217;m not good enough. The conversation had drifted onto another subject. I finally got up my gumption and said I felt I had the skills he was looking for. What is it I lack? (Swallows hard.) If there was some critical skill I need, I should find out what it is so I can correct it.</p>
<p>Turns out, he just wasn&#8217;t aware I was a coder. He discounted me as a potential candidate because of a little misinformation. The rest of the story is predictable. I got the job. EPIC WIN! Kitties. LOLz. Yadda yadda. </p>
<p>The point is that those moments of moxie make all the difference.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/missrogue">Tara Hunt</a> for mentioning the post on twitter this morning. It made my day.</p>
