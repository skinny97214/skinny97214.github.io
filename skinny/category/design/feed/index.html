<p><a href="/skinny/content/uploads/2013/04/sidewalk-chalk-kid.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-1042" alt="sidewalk-chalk-kid" src="/skinny/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sidewalk-chalk-kid-600x450.jpg" width="600" height="450" /></a><span style="font-size: 9px;">Some rights reserved by <a title="original photo at flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/18123948@N00/281857282">matt.forestpath</a></span></p>
<h3>Age Neutral Verification</h3>
<p>This is the biggest area of impact on the interface. If you have a site which offers kid-attractive content, you&#8217;ll need to know if they&#8217;re above thirteen before making an account or storing personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>The problem is that you can&#8217;t actually ask that in a way that indicates that thirteen is the break point. This is what &#8220;age-neutral verification&#8221; means. If only it was as simple as a checkbox that they tick which says &#8220;I am over 13 years of age.&#8221; Nuuuh-uh, not so fast, cowboy. That&#8217;s not legal. (See <a title="COPPA FAQs" href="http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm" target="_blank">FAQ #39 of the COPPA statute</a>.)</p>
<p>If the user fails the age-neutral test, <strong>you must fail in a obtuse way</strong> that doesn&#8217;t indicate to them that the age check was the reason. This defies all good UX principles around writing clear error message that tell people what is actually going on. As much as this boils my cockles, it is the law. But it doesn&#8217;t end there. You must prevent them from turning around trying again. Finally, your company must delete all info from any source that you have about that user.</p>
<h3>Options</h3>
<p><a href="/skinny/content/uploads/2013/04/coppa-birthday-facebook.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1034 alignnone" alt="coppa birthday example from facebook" src="/skinny/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/coppa-birthday-facebook.png" width="511" height="83" /></a></p>
<p>Most providers, including the screenshot from Facebook, are asking for a birth date, as that&#8217;s the example solution given in the law. Facebook&#8217;s popup delicately explains &#8220;Providing your birthday helps make sure you get the right Facebook experience for your age. You can choose to hide this info from your timeline later if you want. For more details, please visit our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/">Data Use Policy</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="/skinny/content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-01-at-2.05.42-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1039" alt="COPPA birth year" src="/skinny/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-01-at-2.05.42-PM.png" width="432" height="100" /></a></p>
<p>Another option is to simplify down to only asking for the birth year. The drawback to this method is that you need to toss out all of the people who turned thirteen that calendar year who would otherwise be able to use your site.</p>
<p><a href="/skinny/content/uploads/2013/04/age-neutral-btwf.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1037 alignnone" alt="Age Neutral Verification BTWF" src="/skinny/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/age-neutral-btwf.png" width="299" height="116" /></a></p>
<p>Lastly, my favorite option is the radio buttons with age ranges approach. This example is from the Born This Way Foundation. It&#8217;s the best UX but the riskiest approach from a legal standpoint.</p>
<h3>Tricks up our sleeve</h3>
<p>Since Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo all are under the same restrictions, they have already asked this question of users. A feature we&#8217;ve been talking about for <a title="Mozilla Persona : the official blog" href="http://identity.mozilla.com/" target="_blank">Persona</a> is to flag such users&#8217; accounts as good to go. As we roll this future feature out, this will mean that we can give sites both a verified email address and a verified age-neutral check.  Again, check with your lawyers to see what sort of documentation you&#8217;ll need to keep around to prove that these third parties were indeed performing the check.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a common perception that people don&#8217;t care about privacy. This is sort of right. Our research shows that most users are unaware of how extensively they&#8217;re being <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/view/424170/how-facebook-leveraged-publishers-desperation-to/">tracked by advertisers</a> across the websites they visit. Even those that do know are unsure of what to do about it. They know there&#8217;s a horrible legalese privacy policy hanging out somewhere. They know they <em>should</em> read it. They don&#8217;t. They know they <em>should</em> use different passwords on each site. They don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Our research found a fatalistic attitude towards privacy and security. We heard everything from &#8220;No one wants my identity anyway. There&#8217;s no money in my bank account.*&#8221; to &#8220;If a hacker wanted to get in, I&#8217;m sure they could. I wouldn&#8217;t even know where to begin to defend myself.&#8221; <em>*Note: that&#8217;s not how identity theft works.</em></p>
<p>The kind of privacy they care about is from the people closest to them that could physically pick up their phone or computer. This is why people clear browser history and explicitly log out of sites. It&#8217;s not the hacker they&#8217;re worried about, it&#8217;s their visiting mother-in-law or kid sister getting a look at their email or being able to vandalize their Facebook wall. Unlike the big &#8220;P&#8221; privacy, this consequences of this threat are immediate and visceral. The potential costs to their reputation are perceived to be higher than anything a hacker could or would do.</p>
<p>Further, we found that the existing password manager is under serving the majority of our users. Many people aren&#8217;t having the browser save their passwords because it leaves their account wide open to anyone who has physical access to their device. It doesn&#8217;t defend against the primary threat they&#8217;re worried about. They are left with no tools to help.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s little wonder we see such bad statistics on password reuse. We&#8217;ve told people not reuse passwords, but it&#8217;s a cognitive impossibility to comply. It&#8217;s like saying you could avoid drowning by walking on water. Worse, even, is that everyone I&#8217;ve interviewed apologies for not having a good enough memory. We&#8217;ve done no service to our users by making them feel stupid or inadequate.</p>
<p>The Persona team has been busy prototyping better tools that address this set of user needs. Follow us on twitter at <a title="Mozilla Persona on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/mozillapersona" target="_blank">@mozillapersona</a> to hear about these experiments and more.</p>

<p>In an exasperated voice <em>&#8220;Why is it so hard to get designers in open source.&#8221;</em> I hear this all the time. Well firstly, it depends on what sorts of skills you&#8217;re talking about. Just like in code, there are small tactical problems that are good first bugs. Even the simplest issue requires a knowledge of the design patterns that the site employs.</p>
<p>Many of the bugs, however, require a deep understanding of why the product exists in the marketplace and a thorough understanding of the research that underpins the project. These strategic questions are analogous to what a software architect would do. I was on the Persona project full time for three months before I felt confident making significant choices about UX.</p>
<p>Open source generally isn&#8217;t welcoming to designers. A shock, I know! There are many reasons for this.</p>
<ol>
<li>In general, <strong>coders don&#8217;t know what to expect from us</strong>. My conception of what I do often bears little resemblance to what coders think I do. When I join a team that&#8217;s never worked closely with a UX designer, I have to educate them. Otherwise, there&#8217;s a gap of misunderstanding that leads to stress and unhappiness. We get up in your business and ask you to change things that you don&#8217;t want to change because
<ul>
<li>It seems trivial and unimportant.</li>
<li>Conversely, it&#8217;s <em>too hard</em>.</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t agree.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ultimately, we&#8217;re beholden to convince a dev to implement our bug, likely because we don&#8217;t code or even if we do it&#8217;s not the best use of our time to be implementing. (If you want to pick a fight, insult a designer by asking why we don&#8217;t &#8220;just learn to code.&#8221;) We&#8217;re starting from a disadvantaged position. In version control systems such as github, <strong>code talks and designers don&#8217;t speak the language</strong>.</li>
<li>Probably the most daunting question for projects without any design lead that has the trust of the team is, <strong>how do the devs know if the proposed design is correct</strong>? Without that trust, bugs quickly devolve into nasty arguments. How you build that trust has been the subject of entire books. But the question remains, who and how do you approve a mockup? The code review process works great for just that&#8230; code.</li>
<li>Github issues and their parallels track problems at a level of granularity that&#8217;s useful for devs. The UX problems that constitute my work are of a much larger granularity. When I add such a strategic issues to the tracker, it makes devs uncomfortable. There&#8217;s nothing actionable here. There&#8217;s nothing to implement. My job is to think through big issues. By the time I&#8217;ve converted it into something a dev would recognize as a bug, my work is done. Thus, <strong>representing the work of a designer requires a shift in culture</strong> of the dev team so that they won&#8217;t close down my issues.</li>
<li>My UX bugs are all tracked publicly in <a title="Persona Issues on Github" href="https://github.com/mozilla/browserid/issues">Persona&#8217;s github</a> and yet I can count on one hand the number of UX volunteers that have contributed to the project. It&#8217;s not that there aren&#8217;t any good first bugs, its that <strong>there is a shortage of UX/UI designers in the market</strong>. Yes, I&#8217;m sure Mozilla could do a better job of getting designers to volunteer. We know it and we&#8217;re working on it.</li>
</ol>
<p>The solutions to all these problems lie in communication and building a trusted relationship. It&#8217;s a higher barrier for designers that takes time to overcome. I&#8217;ve found all of my team to be receptive when I&#8217;ve taken the time to explain the principles that guide my decisions. I work with an awesome group of super smart folks! They just need to know I&#8217;ve got this handled. The longer we work together, the more shorthanded my explanations can be. Designers start by renovating small stuff and move up to innovating as they build their reputation. As the paid UX designers in Mozilla change the culture, it will become more welcoming because we will have laid the groundwork.

<p>Without someone in the c-level or steering committee with a design background to speak on users&#8217; behalf, Mozilla is missing out. Engineers and business people see entirely different challenges. Without all sides (technical needs, business needs, user needs), we have a giant blind spot.</p>
<h3>Chief of Experience? Never heard of one.</h3>
<p>If everyone jumped off the bridge, would you do it too? It&#8217;s true, there aren&#8217;t many tech companies, especially open-source ones that have a design representative at the executive level. Google, Microsoft, Opera, Facebook, Intel, Amazon and even Adobe lack it. There are some surprising companies that do. Oracle has a Chief Evangelist of User Experience. Flipboard has a Head of Design. Nokia and Yahoo have a Senior VP of Design. You might&#8217;ve heard of the most notable SVP of Design, Johnny Ive of Apple. You&#8217;ll note titles of this position haven&#8217;t settled down, not surprising given the short time the discipline has been around.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an opportunity for Mozilla to be the first big open-source tech company to deeply bake design DNA into the process. Gary (CEO) has been exalting us to to produce a kick-ass product. UX and UR are a source of innovation. Further, prioritizing around user needs is essential to making an excellent product.</p>
<p><a href="/skinny/content/uploads/2011/11/Tesla-Roadster-Sport-Tesla-Motors-to-Open-Colorado-Gallery-Rear-Angle.jpg"><img title="Tesla-Roadster-Sport-Tesla-Motors-to-Open-Colorado-Gallery-Rear-Angle" src="/skinny/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Tesla-Roadster-Sport-Tesla-Motors-to-Open-Colorado-Gallery-Rear-Angle-600x337.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></a></p>
<p>One bit I didn&#8217;t expect in my survey was that the Chief of Design is a well-established role in car companies. Tesla, BMW, Volvo&#8230; they all have one. It&#8217;s curious to me because car manufacturers are entrenched in technical, mechanical requirements as well. Seems as though they&#8217;ve figured out that it takes more than the feature list and specifications to sell cars to people.</p>
<h3>Get to the point</h3>
<ol>
<li>UX is an objective discipline, not something based on feelings about which shade of blue is prettier.</li>
<li>It should be an organizational priority that blocks projects from launching in the same way the infrasec does.</li>
<li>UX is vital part of every project. We shouldn&#8217;t DO a project unless a trained interaction designer can ensure user needs are met. Until UX is included from the very beginning, before requirements are written, it will be chasing after product and engineering.</li>
</ol>
<h3>So what do we DO?</h3>
<ol>
<li>We need someone with an interaction design background at the c-level and/or steering committee.</li>
<li>Hire UX at a sane number. The ratio in my group is 30:1. It should be around 4:1.</li>
<li>Until we can do that, hire contractors to pick up the slack.</li>
</ol>

<p>===== UPDATE 12/6/2012 =====</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the end of the year. Time for a progress report. Just a few months after I wrote this we reorganized user experience designers and researchers into their own functional team. I was immensely happy for one of our own, Jinghua Zhang, to be promoted as Director of User Experience. In our org chart, that makes her a level 5. VP and C-levels are as high as it goes at level 6. I&#8217;m very proud to see Mozilla&#8217;s progress this year. Onward!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I visited <a title="ziba industrial design agency" href="http://ziba.com">Ziba</a> on a sunny, crisp fall day. (Yes, we do have them at least once a decade here in Portland.) One of their talented creative directors, Kai Halsinger, was generous enough to show me around the studio and talk about what makes it all work. Specifically on my mind was how their physical space influence the work they do. This building was carefully considered to support their creative process.</p>
<p>A little background for those unfamiliar: Ziba is an experience design firm here in Portland. If you&#8217;ve seen a recent Wacom tablet or the beautifully high-low TDK boombox, you&#8217;ve appreciated their <a href="http://www.ziba.com/#/work/">work</a>.</p>
<p>Two things stood out to me about their offices.</p>
<p><a href="/skinny/content/uploads/2011/11/ziba-names.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-642" title="ziba-names" src="/skinny/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/ziba-names-600x414.jpg" alt="ziba emphasis on individual contributors" width="600" height="414" /></a></p>
<h3>Emphasis on the individual contributor</h3>
<p>Yes, the giant roboman is awesome, but look across. Right when you walk in the lobby, the wall behind reception is covered in the names of the employees. It might seem like a small thing, that is unless you are one of the names on the wall. The list contains the current employees in chronological order of when they started to work for Ziba. The talent is really all information/innovation companies are. This might not resonate as much in non-Westerners where the highest good is to be part of a whole, but from this little girl from Arkansas, much respect.</p>
<p><a href="/skinny/content/uploads/2011/11/ziba-project-rooms.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-637" title="ziba-project-room" src="/skinny/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/ziba-project-rooms-600x440.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<h3>Project rooms</h3>
<p>The desks at Ziba are kept deliberately small. There are no cubes. The desks are arranged into long rows. Funny thing was, almost no one was at their desk. Kai said and observation confirmed, folks spend the majority of their time inside project rooms. The uninitiated might assume it was merely a conference room where no one had bothered to clean all the stuff off the walls.</p>
<p>This space was organized around the core idea that the best, most creative work is done when you get people out from behind their desks into a big room. Squeezed together around a big table, people can cheat off their neighbor&#8217;s test paper, or as we call it in the professional world, cross-pollination. As they develop concepts, mockups are printed out and pinned around the room. They have giant format plotters for printing oversize documents. There are post-its from various brainstorming methodologies confettied across the walls. Whiteboards are covered in elegant scrawls.</p>
<p>Because the room is dedicated to a client, you never have to clear off the walls to make room for someone else. The cruft can accumulate. The importance of this not obvious at first, but is key to the creative process. You have to absorb the idea or form for at least a few days. The most important benefit of the project rooms is to never lose ideas &#8211; pin them up &#8211; and then to be able to connect previously disjointed thoughts or see new patterns that spark further ideas. This space allows time for designs to live and breathe so you can properly figure out what is working. You&#8217;ll walk in one morning and it&#8217;ll be obvious what to do next. This can&#8217;t be rushed.</p>
<p>Ziba generally keeps one project room per client. There may be more than one project in the room at a time. It&#8217;s a big benefit to keep the design languages consistent as each takes shape.</p>
<p>I also spoke to <a title="twitter - Bill DeRouchey" href="https://twitter.com/#!/billder">Bill DeRouchey</a>, former Interim Director when this building was brand new. He was in their previous space as well. The project rooms there had been retrofitted into the existing footprint, not as perfectly. He said they didn&#8217;t have enough for all of the work to go in project rooms, so mockups, notes, cruft flowed out into the halls. Some of the best insights were from someone not assigned to that client randomly walking by and stopping to take a look. It&#8217;s an open question whether the serendipity from this imperfection is worth more than the clean beauty and efficiency of the current space.</p>
<p>Kai said clients make great effort and take great pleasure in coming to work in &#8220;their&#8221; project rooms with the creative teams. I asked how they extended the experience when clients aren&#8217;t able to travel on a regular basis. Not surprisingly, they&#8217;ve cooked up a clever solution. There is a panoramic camera that takes a 360 degree shot so they can pan and zoom around and see how things are morphing.</p>
<p>I hope to steal this trick and the project room concept for Mozilla. Project rooms are by no means a shocking new idea for agencies. They&#8217;ve been using them for years. I&#8217;m writing this to bring it to light so that engineering-driven companies who have in-house design groups like Mozilla can steal this idea. Designers&#8217; needs are distinct from developers and not so obvious.</p>
<p>The key bits are</p>
<ul>
<li>expansive whiteboards</li>
<li>pinboards</li>
<li>post-its</li>
<li>a way of printing things out in large format</li>
<li>a large conference table in the middle</li>
<li>a great team that constantly curates the room and evolves the vision</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, Ziba is an inspiring, beautiful place filled with unnecessarily clever (ok, maybe necessarily clever) people. I suspect it&#8217;s a wonderful space to come to every day.</p>

<p>Words need to be hyphenated because paragraphs need to be justified. But do you know why most justified texts aren’t very readable even though it looks visually pleasing at a glance? It’s not because they’re justified. It’s because they’re not justified carefully.</p>
<p>Mental exercise: why is the documents you’ve justified in MS Word so hard to read compared to a book? Justified text in books looks great because a lot of things have been adjusted:</p>
<ol>
<li>Margin kerning. E.g. hanging punctuation.
</li>
<li>Character kerning. Ie. letter-spacing needs to be made tighter or looser to make the appearance more even to the eye. <a href="http://texblog.net/png/blindtext.png"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
</li>
<li>Additional kerning for specific characters. E.g. when typesetting French, you’d need to add a word space before (:) and after («»), and a thin space before (?), (!) and (;). <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/punc.htm"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
</li>
<li>Word-spacing. You can’t rely on spacing that’s mechanically widened to fit the paragraph width.
</li>
<li>Ligatures. Ie. when you letterspace loosely, ligatures should be turned off.</li>
</ol>
<p>Justified text in a word processor doesn’t look pleasing because, well, the application doesn’t come with most of these settings.</p>
<p>But how far ahead (or behind) are web browsers in this department? All browsers have a setting to tweak word and letter-spacing (though not finely), and turn ligatures on and off (different browsers, different syntaxes). <a href="http://marc.baffl.co.uk/browser_bugs/css-ligatures.html"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Problem is, you’d need to adjust everything manually.</p>
<p>Firefox does allows for fine control of letterspacing, although it&#8217;s the only browser that does. Here&#8217;s a great discussion of this still frustrating topic on the <a href="http://treehouseagency.com/blog/tim-cosgrove/2011/01/22/putting-letter-spacing-under-microscope">Treehouse Agency blog</a>.</p>
<p>Sure, everything I’ve just described kind of returned us back at square one. But this isn’t to say that justified text isn’t appropriate to use on the web. Here’s how you can start today:</p>
<p>Many of us have control over words on the webpage, even as designers and developers. We can add, remove or change words around to make the word-spacing more even. If not, we have the capability to ask the copywriter sitting in the next room if this nicely-fitted wording still conveys the meaning just as well as the last version.</p>
<p>Since doing this to every paragraph isn’t practical, you might want to limit the use of justified spacing to shorter bodies of text that are easier to control in terms of wording. Longer subheads and introductory paragraphs are perfect.</p>

It&#8217;s been a year. What do I have to show for myself? For one, a little site called <a href="http://iconrainbow.com">IconRainbow</a> I made with the patient assistance of Ryan Snyder, aka <a href="http://twitter.com/ryansnyder">@ryansnyder</a>. It&#8217;s all about the purdy colors, specifically colors of icons pulled from the iPhone app store.</p>
<h3>Why color?</h3>
<p>If you are a designer, I would tell you that it&#8217;s eye candy; a place for designers to come find inspiration. </p>
<p>If you were a dev, I would tell you that it&#8217;s a different sort data visualization of the iPhone store; a way to take in several hundred apps at a glance.</p>
<p>If you were an investor, I would tell you that the big picture is to aggregate color information from all over the web and analyze that data to determine trends; that the iPhone store is only our first data set.</p>
<h3>Why the iPhone app store?</h3>
<p>Well, for several reasons, most importantly because there is a built-in quality filter. There&#8217;s a higher bar in terms of complexity and therefore expense to get an app accepted. Also because companies have been given a very well defined task of expressing their brand in that little square of pixels. They&#8217;re forced to simplify the essence of their graphic identity down into one thing. Lastly, nice little squares are all the same size which means I can show a whole bunch of them in a neat grid. This makes me happy.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s next?</h3>
<p>Right now, we only have a subset of about 5,000 icons. That got us up and running, but now it&#8217;s time to get all the data. Ryan is writing a scraper to pull down the entire store with more of the meta data (text of the app descriptions, a link to see the app in the official store, etc.) We&#8217;ll be adding search so you can narrow down which sort of icons you want to see in a more granular way than just categories. </p>
<p>The big monster is the trend data. That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about. We&#8217;ll need to collect data on the whole store for three months and then we&#8217;ll be rolling out an entirely new home page focused on those trends.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it! I&#8217;m doing user interviews to help shape what the new features, especially the home page, will be. Give me a shout on twitter if you&#8217;d like to be a part.</p>
