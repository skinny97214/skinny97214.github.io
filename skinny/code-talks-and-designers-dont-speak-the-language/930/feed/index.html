		<description><![CDATA[I think the key phrase of this entire post is:

&quot;I’ve found all of my team to be receptive when I’ve taken the time to explain the principles that guide my decisions.&quot;

It doesn&#039;t matter if you are talking UX or coding, if you come in and say &quot;do what I say because I&#039;m an expert&quot; you will get poor responses. If instead you say &quot;do what I am saying because X,Y,Z&quot; you may get people questioning your reasons, but they will engage with you.

this goes hand-in-hand with the problem you refer to in establishing credibility. There are people out there who claim to be UX experts, but who completley kill products because they design for a different set of users than the ones who actually use the software.

look at the gnome project for a long series of flamewars about this topic.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;representing the work of a designer requires a shift in culture of the dev team&quot;

BS. A gigantic and stinking pile of BS.

Becoming _part_ of a dev team requires a shift in culture *of the designed*. 

Designers should stop thinking that they lead or guide the dev team. Make your _proposals_ in a humble and collaborative language and you will be heard, like everybody else. Try to impose your &quot;vision&quot; from high in the sky and you will be... ignored. It&#039;s that simple.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is also true the other way around. I still haven&#039;t figured out myself how to get input on UX and design on things. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=753163 for example is still a complete fail, and I don&#039;t know why. The discussion we had about timing of animations was similarly obscure, as I experienced it.

I&#039;d love to trust the answers I get, but I still haven&#039;t figured out how to phrase the questions such that they get answers.]]></description>
