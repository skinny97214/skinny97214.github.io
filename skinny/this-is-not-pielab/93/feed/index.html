		<description><![CDATA[Crystal,

It sounds as though you&#039;ve decided to change the name. It&#039;s the right decision under these circumstances. Right out of school, I worked for a company who went through a similar ordeal. The plaintiff argued that (1) they had used the name for a longer period of time, (2) that the average person &quot;on the street&quot; might confuse the two entities, and (3) that while the two companies&#039; activities were not exactly the same, they could be at some point. From a legal perspective, it was an open and shut case. They were protecting the integrity of their brand. 

Given the construction of the name, there is potential confusion about the relationship with PieLab, which would have eventually caught up with you. The addition of PDX suggests an extension. To be honest, when I first heard about your project, I thought that there was a relationship with the Alabama project, and that PieLab(s) might be making their way to other parts of the country. I met Mr. Bielenberg briefly at Compostmodern last year and have been following Project M for years. Their work is incredible, and among creatives, they are a well-known entity. 

Now, with all that said, I absolutely know that without a second thought, that your comments regarding intent were entirely sincere. I wholly believe that there was no intention to use a name that belonged to another entity and that the scale and focus of your endeavor was intended to be considerably different. But the world is simply becoming smaller. Regardless of the content or tone of your correspondence, you had contact with PieLab. With your creative mind, that would have seemed enough to change course once you became aware of the situation, no matter how much you work you had behind the effort. 

So, you made a mistake? No problem. Chalk it up to experience. Your project is going to be excellent. I know that to be true. Make it entirely yours and make it amazing. I would expect nothing less from you. And consider yourself lucky that this came about now, and not six months (and countless more hours) into your effort.

I hope that the folks in Alabama, and others who are passionate about those efforts, will only continue to grow. From my view, they too made mistakes in their tone in response, but I certainly understand how it happened. When the time comes and all parties find themselves in the same place, I hope that glasses will be raised. There are too many smart, well-intentioned folks involved on both sides to not agree to work at working together.

Keep it up, sister. You&#039;ll be amused that as a postscript (as I&#039;m writing this), I&#039;m currently listening to PieCast, via KCRW in Santa Monica. Our friends at Whiffies are going to be pissed! ;-)

Kindly, 
Eric]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Skinny,

Great idea, and too bad those other PieLab folk are being so &quot;now now&quot; about it. Yours is still a great idea, and although I agree with others... not absolutely necessary for you to change, it is probably for the best. I am sure you can come up with an equally good -- if not *Better* name!

Piepal, pie &#039;n the sky, pie around, pie n pi, pie 2 the people, pie a la cart! pie 4u, can i haz pie? pie anxiety, (*no*) pie co-lab (as in collaboration), pie game, slice of life, pie endeavor, pie calling, pie one on... I could go on, but you have obviously been through the brainstorming process, and surely will cook up something fresh and un-like others.

Best wishes on the cart. Pie is good. - m]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1st came Pie Lab in New Zealand. They sell pie. They&#039;re also a bar that sells alcohol.

2nd came PieLab in Alabama. They sell pie. They&#039;re also a community space.

3rd Pie Lab in Oregon. They sell pie. They&#039;re also a mobile social-economics game.

It now appears the Alabama PieLab wants the Oregon Pie Lab to change it&#039;s name on the grounds that is has a nearly, but not identical name, and that they both sell pie despite serving completely different communities; BUT doesn&#039;t want to change it&#039;s own name because they believe they are substantially different from the New Zealand Pie Lab despite the fact that they both sell pie, their names are nearly but not identical, and they serve completely different communities. 

Is that about right?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Greensborites: I don&#039;t see the problem. A tiny food cart 2000 miles away shares your name. Don&#039;t be so prickish about it.

See also: Mint (finance, analytics), Apple (computers, records), St. Johns (university, university, university...), the aforementioned Barista. Names are not globally unique. I can almost guarantee that you&#039;ve never eaten in a restaurant or drank in a bar with a GUID for a name.

There is no intentional confusion here; your hurt pride and opprobrium are disingenuous at best.

Deal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Honestly, PieLab sounds like a place that is focused on pies.  I can eat tons of &quot;different things + conversation&quot; and &quot;= ideas&quot;.  The AL PieLabs doesn&#039;t sound like pie is their main gig.  Maybe THEY should come up with something more descriptive of what they actually do, as I don&#039;t think PieLabs does them justice.

I say keep the name as-is.  There are boat loads of businesses that share names across spaces and do so without snide comments and threats.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Derek,

I would definitely have said what I said online to her in person. I believe adults can have healthy discussions about issues. Preferably over an adult beverage. I thought her kickstarter project was a great idea &amp; I plan on backing her project after she changes the name. 

I&#039;m a passionate individual. I&#039;m not angry about this situation. It is possible to say everything I&#039;ve said without being angry while saying it.
A couple of my tweets were a little too inflammatory. I apologize for my e-tone. 

I look forward to supporting the pie cart &amp; maybe one day I&#039;ll make it to Portland &amp; get to eat a slice.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m very glad you&#039;ve made the decision to change the name of your project. The folks behind PieLab have worked very hard to build a meaningful experience and have reach far beyond Greensboro, Alabama. 

I&#039;m sure you didn&#039;t have bad intentions, but from a creative stand point, the decision to move forward with the name was a bit lazy. If you are claiming to have an original idea, then please make it truly original.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Probably a good move to change the name to avoid problems, but don&#039;t take it too hard. 

Seems to me a lot of trouble could have been avoided if the PieLab people had said &quot;Hi there, we just wanted to let you know that we&#039;re concerned about you using our name, let&#039;s have a talk about this.&quot;

Instead, Charlotte and Joey fell into the typical internet trap of assuming that you were being dishonest and posting nasty comments on your kickstarter page that (hopefully) they would never have said to your face.

I can&#039;t blame you for being a little defensive after reading that, considering how much effort you&#039;ve put into this already.

People get emotional on both sides when they&#039;ve put a lot of effort into something near to their heart.

Should you change the name? 
Yeah. 

Were you trying to deceive people into thinking you were affiliated with the other PieLab? 
Unlikely. 

Should you have taken the AL PieLab  conflict more seriously? 
Possibly... 

Should everyone have got so upset about this? 
Definitely not.


Personally, I&#039;ve got a chemistry background so would probably be a little wary eating at either place called &quot;PieLab,&quot; considering the stuff I used to work with in the lab...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi John,

I can see that there are good folks on your side who love you and have come out swinging to defend your work. 

I offer my sincerest apologies. I had not heard of your work before I conceived the name. I knew you existed when I registered the twitter account, yes. 

I didn&#039;t realize how much recognition you&#039;d received. If I had, I wouldn&#039;t have gone forward with the name. 

This food cart is a small, quick project for me in my spare time. I have full time job plus a handful of other side projects. I just wanted to make a decision and move the project forward. I didn&#039;t give it the full due diligence. 

Sometimes you make a quick decision and it&#039;s wrong. 

I will change the name. Please grant me a little time to recollect myself, find and properly research a new name.]]></description>
