<p>&#8212;&#8211;UPDATE&#8212;&#8211;<br />
After a lovely conversation with John of Project M, the founder of PieLab in Greensboro, AL, he generously offered to let me keep using the name.  I&#8217;m very grateful to have his support.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Help.</p>
<p>I have received a couple of angry messages since starting my Kickstarter Project about my name being the same as a very successful <a href="http://pielab.org">PieLab in Greensboro, AL</a>. I have to tell you, it makes me sick in my heart. When I was going through the process of brainstorming names, I kept coming back to pieLab because is was simple, short, and hinted at the game strategy aspect of the cart. I had several names such as Wonder Pie Spot, Pookie Pie, and Grumble Bunny, but none of them communicated that this wasn&#8217;t just a cart where you went up and ordered and everything was as usual. My biggest fear was that there was a well-known co-working space in town called <a href="http://piepdx.com/">PIE (Portland Incubator Experiment)</a>. Well, what can I do about that? They decided to name their tech space after my delicious treat. Nothing to be done. My name will have &#8220;pie&#8221; in it somewhere.</p>
<p>When I decided to go with the name pieLab, I went to register the name and discovered that it was already taken. I had never heard of the PieLab from 3000 miles away. I went and had a look at the <a href="http://pielab.org">pielab.org</a> site. I saw their essence as being a collaborative of graphic designers where to community is invited in to share ideas. I watched their video where they cut up a pie and pour some coffee. I decided we were not similar enough to be a problem and registered <a href="http://twitter.com/pielabpdx">@pieLabPDX</a>. </p>
<p>With the negative comments, I&#8217;ve gone back through the site to discover whether we really are TOO similar. I downloaded the press release. I read the press coverage. There was a lot I didn&#8217;t learn about the project in my initial run through. It&#8217;s grown into training people to be chefs and work in retail. They have outreach to youth. It&#8217;s an amazing program. I didn&#8217;t realize how thoroughly it had been covered by GOOD, ID Magazine, Fast Company, etc. People in their community have obviously been touched by their efforts. </p>
<p>A lot of people love their PieLab in Greensboro, AL. I can see how they would be upset for anyone to threaten the organization that&#8217;s done so much good.</p>
<p>If I had to distill them down into three words they would be community development, graphic design, and pie. </p>
<p>We have that last characteristic in common, it is true. But I&#8217;m not inviting collaborators and it&#8217;s not a community space. I&#8217;m not training others or doing youth development. And yes, I do graphic design occasionally as that is my background, but this cart is not about visual design. </p>
<p>My entire reason for building this is that I&#8217;m fascinated by game strategy and behavioral economics and want a way to tweak every possible subtlety of the process of selecting and paying for a humble piece of pie. The pie is the bait for my human subject rat maze experiment. I don&#8217;t see any hint of this in their project.</p>
<p>I am unabashedly copying an idea, without a doubt. This is a recreation of a <a href="http://www.cabel.name/2009/09/kashiwa-mystery-cafe.html">mystery cafe as told by Cabel Sasser</a> as I have made clear from the very beginning.</p>
<p>For goodness sakes, if I was going to straight copy them, at least I&#8217;d have the good sense to change the name if I was trying to pull the wool over everyone&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>I feel like pieLab is a rather obvious name. I doubt Barista coffee would be surprised to find that there is another clever coffee house out there sharing their name. I could see that it would be a big problem if another one opened up around here. States protect names within each state for good reason. PieLab is not trademarked as far as I my research shows.</p>
<p>So what to do now? The name was sincerely a coincidence. I certainly did not anticipate this blow back and don&#8217;t wish to cause undue harm to their brand. It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m so far into the project that I can&#8217;t redirect. I am loathe to do anything until the Kickstarter project is finished if only because I just cannot face reworking the stop motion video, and I don&#8217;t want to risk losing momentum. Thoughts? </p>

UPDATE<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>To John (leader of Project M PieLab in Greensboro, AL,</p>
<p>I can see that there are good folks on your side who love you and have come out swinging to defend your work.</p>
<p>I offer my sincerest apologies. I had not heard of your work before I conceived the name. I knew you existed when I registered the twitter account, yes.</p>
<p>I didn’t realize how much recognition you’d received. If I had, I wouldn’t have gone forward with the name.</p>
<p>This food cart is a small, quick project for me in my spare time. I have full time job plus a handful of other side projects. I just wanted to make a decision and move the project forward. I didn’t give it the full due diligence.</p>
<p>Sometimes you make a quick decision and it’s wrong.</p>
<p>I will change the name. Please grant me a little time to recollect myself, find and properly research a new name.</p>
