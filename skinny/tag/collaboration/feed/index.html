<p>Why aren&#8217;t sites like BaseCamp, PivotalTracker or Google Buzz (just kidding)  on this grid? Honestly, because I don&#8217;t know quite where they fall on the grid. They usually rely on hooks into email to notify of change. Also, because I&#8217;ve yet to work at a place that uses it and is completely happy with their system.</p>
<p>Here are some thoughts collected from twitter on what are the best tools and techniques for collaboration:</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/rgleeson">@rgleeson</a>: &#8220;Honestly? 1. Skype video (with shared screen), 2. Mobile device, and 3. google docs&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/tyeshasnow">@tyeshasnow</a>: &#8220;Sometimes old school verbal communication is the best way. Let&#8217;s all start picking up the phone more often 5 mins = 10 email exchanges.&#8221; I would argue a five minute conversation is equivalent to 100 email exchanges. No one is going to have that many. The two are almost not even comparable.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/al3x">@al3x</a>: &#8220;A few days ago, @danbenjamin and I had a conversation. Less tech, more process. You can listen to it at <a href="http://bit.ly/bsKoGI">http://bit.ly/bsKoGI</a>&#8221;<br />
If you listen in, at about 11:00 he talks about the collaboration when he was employed at Twitter. The gist of it is some of the best employees are remote. The collaboration that happens when you&#8217;re remote is higher value because you&#8217;re forced to put it into a place that&#8217;s visible to everyone. He continues on about other projects&#8230; only tangentially related to collaboration, but interesting nonetheless.</p>
<p>For me, the golden chalice of collaboration would be to recreate the serendipity created by working in the same physical space in a remote setup. I think the advantages of working remotely are well established: ability to work with the best people despite geography, tailoring your schedule and workspace to suit, etc. However, you loose the serendipity of casual chatter &#8211; the ability to spin your chair around and have a five minute consult with your coworker.</p>
<p>My next experiment to capture that is to hijack twitter for this purpose. Using a tool that can monitor multiple accounts such as CoTweet or HootSuite makes it possible to do this without going crazy. Create a private twitter account. Follow your virtual coworkers&#8217; private accounts. Chatter away! My hope is that by tapping into one of the screens that I&#8217;m already paying attention to during the day that I&#8217;ll minimize the effort involved. Why private? To allow more unfiltered and/or top-secret conversations. Also, to function as a filter so that you can switch into that conversation among a small number of folks.</p>
<p>As always, I&#8217;m writing about this not because I consider myself to be any authority but to draw out critiques and ideas from you guys. Comments are most welcome.</p>
