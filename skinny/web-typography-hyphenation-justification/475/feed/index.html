		<description><![CDATA[Sam, you brought up a good point. I think there needs to be CSS-level control not only over how type looks: style, line length, etc.—but also on how it works: justification spacing algorithm, hyphenation rule, preventing widows, etc.

This way, even when the text appearance may be different (due to rendering engines and unavailability of webfonts), the way it’s set on paragraph will still conform to a rule that designers can set. Simply put: it may flow differently, but it’ll look sharp.

This might be something worth proposing to the Gecko team and the W3C-font working group.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Typesetting in the browser faces the additional challenge that there are so many variables: column widths, font-size (OS/device variation and user preference), font-family, etc. These conditions are getting more diverse as we see more and more web-capable devices emerge, not the other way around.

Tweaking copy to &quot;fit&quot; assumes these variables are locked down - and everyone shares the same experience. Not so, though you can kid yourself if you restrict your testing to environments that agree with your assumptions. That said, I guess its the 80/20 rule: all you can do is make it look right for most, and allow it to degrade nicely further down the curve.

Ultimately, the typesetter has to be the browser; as a designer the best you can do is provide hints and break copy up to make it more likely to flow nicely. So the sooner the browser vendors take this one, the better]]></description>
