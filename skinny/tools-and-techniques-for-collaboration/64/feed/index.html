		<description><![CDATA[Instead of Twitter, what about Yammer (like Twitter but for inside companies?) It reduces the chance that someone&#039;s Twitter account with sensitive company information accidentally gets made public as a result of simple user error, Twitter bug or account hacking.

I personally love some old school tools, like IRC channels where people hang out &amp; chat. Similarly, group chats via XMPP  /Jabber server the same purpose. We have an IRC channel for MeeGo that I use pretty much all day to talk to other people on the project. These channels can be public or private / logged or not logged depending on how they are set up.

At Jive, we used their collaboration tools inside the firewall for private discussions and document collaboration. You could do this for free with an secure open source forum + wiki.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While (definitely) over-hyped during launch(es), both WAVE and BUZZ (set to private) have enormous potential for collaborative realtime work.  Worth trying, they&#039;ll end up on your grid.

You have to consider that TWITTER&#039;s APIs restrict in/out data flow, so, you can experience long lag times.  Why bother?  Of course, less-steroidic olde-fashioned group chat IM works too, combined with SKYPE and BASECAMP (with white-board and also SMS notifications), it&#039;s really pretty easy to create distance working structures.]]></description>
