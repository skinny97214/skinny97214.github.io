		<description><![CDATA[AOL? Really? I&#039;m entertained by this comment. That link from 2002 is as outdated as their ill-fated business strategy.

Seriously though, if a business relationship does exists (and it may), I&#039;ve not heard mention of it. The majority of revenue comes from the partnership with Google. Conspiracy theorists would be well advised to dig into that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good lord and little fishes! Everyone has been stressing about what the fourth bullet point was. I&#039;ll spill.

It was about diversity at Mozilla.

I couldn&#039;t figure out how to write it in short form that didn&#039;t sound like I was shilling some terrible HR statement required by law. I decided it was worthy of its own post whenever I could speak to the subject with more authority.

That said... Mozilla needs more ladies, more ethnicities, more folks in general that have a different viewpoint. We spent a lot of time in our private offsite last week discussing how we could do more than lip service to make that happen. I hope to give concrete examples of our progress soon.]]></description>
