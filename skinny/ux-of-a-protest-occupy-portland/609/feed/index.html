		<description><![CDATA[Brave of you, and you are not tiny. For doing this, you are real. Real does not measure height (I&#039;m 78&quot; and still real). Keep it real, and stand for - and sit with - what you believe in. OWS is huge, we have all been burned by WS... even those of us who don&#039;t know it, or choose(?) not to believe it. Crowds... fascinating, yes... but that&#039;s another post!]]></description>
