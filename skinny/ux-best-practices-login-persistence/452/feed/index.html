AND - if people around you are THAT nefarious, do you think they wouldn&#039;t be able to find out your password?  A cleverly hidden webcam, social engineering or even a key-logger can easily be used to get your password and then OH NOES - THEY&#039;VE ORDERED FROM AMAZON!  BTW - remind me to not go to work for your company.  Their &quot;use an atom bomb to kill a fly&quot; way of doing things means I wouldn&#039;t get along well with them.

		<description><![CDATA[Using the locked door as the metaphor isn&#039;t a very helpful for most sites. The useful metaphor is recognizing a friend&#039;s face so you can call upon your history together to have a meaningful conversation. 

I refuse to lock down sites to the nth degree because of malicious users for the same reason I don&#039;t believe being forced to take of my shoes at the airport makes me any safer. It&#039;s security as theater. 

Users absolutely have the freedom to logout of any site at any time. Private browsing is always a good idea if you&#039;re not on your own personal machine. Also, you&#039;re not required to log into support.mozilla.com to use the majority of features.

The risks are almost equal in having the session never expire as having it expire in one day. Should users have to reauthenticate themselves every 30 minutes? Every 5? It&#039;s just an absurd way to approach it.

Relying on sessions for real security will never be the solution.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;OH NOES! They could add tons of comments to your TPR report generator site in someone else’s name! OH THE HORROR!&quot;

If there&#039;s a login, there&#039;s something worth protecting even if that&#039;s just an identity. If it&#039;s not worth protecting cut out the middleman and don&#039;t waste time with a bespoke login at all.

Saying something is important enough to justify a login but not important enough to bother providing people with the option to keep that login secure makes no sense. It&#039;s like handing someone a door key and then saying &quot;but if you need to get in, you can always use the one hung on the wall there - don&#039;t worry, only people in this flat are near to that wall and they&#039;re all sound.&quot;

&quot;Amazon has sorted this out.&quot;

Really? At my enterprise Amazon has almost single-handedly resulted in the banning of accessing e-commerce web sites in our contracts. The reason for that clause? Because the company doesn&#039;t want to be liable if another employee comes along and buys something on my account. That doesn&#039;t sound a success story to me.

&quot;a) anyone else even using the same site as you, so how would they discover that you’re already logged in?&quot;

History. Awesome bar. Watching over your shoulder. Behaviour patterns. Somebody looking to cause mischief is going to be-line straight for those. The opportunity is staring them in face.

&quot;b) anyone caring to do malice on some random site&quot;

You&#039;re making security assumptions on the grounds that everyone is huggy and friendly? &#039;Fraping&#039; is standard practice - it doesn&#039;t take much imagination to see why somebody would think to sneak on your machine and, perhaps, do something &#039;funny&#039; which happened to be malicious as well. It happens around me on a daily basis.

You may trust your colleagues and that random dude in the library not to think &quot;hey, I can post some swear words on this guy&#039;s work account and get him fired. That&#039;d be funny&quot; but I certainly don&#039;t. I don&#039;t appreciate you choosing to make that decision for me instead of giving me, as a user, the freedom to choose.

But thanks for the heads up: I now know support.mozilla.com should not be used on a public/work machine without taking extra precautions out of my way which damage my UX because I need to make behavioural exceptions for that site that I do not for any other as they all provide a consistent method of bypassing it: The &quot;Remember Me&quot; box.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree that on sites like Facebook, anything that has financial info, email providers, and such that have especially sensitive info there should still be a remember me option.

b) anyone caring to do malice on some random site

Most of us aren&#039;t working on sites that fit into the sensitive info category, so we should reduce the user friction as much as possible.
