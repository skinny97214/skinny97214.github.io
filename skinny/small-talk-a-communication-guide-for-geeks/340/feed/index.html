		<description><![CDATA[Leaving aside the actual thesis of your post (&quot;small talk allows you to assess your counterpart&#039;s mood and engagement&quot;), I&#039;m fascinated by the chart:

- I find IRC conversations draining, while IRL conversations charge me up --- assuming they&#039;re going well.

- Effort and engagement being so strongly correlated, I wonder if they&#039;re not really aspects of the same thing. I guess what one looks for is ways to lower the effort while retaining the engagement: lower-right-ward motion. Thus: audio phone is preferable to video phone.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I too prefer that people get to the point with an IM, especially if they are requesting info from me. By doing so: &quot;Hey Adam, what is the current page count of the Communications chapter?&quot; it means that regardless of whether they are AFK or not when I get around to answering their message, I can give them a complete answer. My part of the loop is therefore closed and I don&#039;t have to wonder what they wanted and if it was important.

It&#039;s OK to do the ritual stuff, but I think it&#039;s best if people also jump right to the point as opposed to waiting for a reply to said rituals.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah I see the source of our different perspectives.

(Thanks for the chart!)

I treat IM as more/mostly *async* because people tend to be doing many other things at the same time (like commenting on a blog post). (IRC is pseudo-async like this as well for similar reasons).

Which is quite different from true sync comms like phone, video-chat, or in-person, where there is a much greater expectation of attention/focus, and the absence thereof is much more noticeable (silences are effectively part of the content of the comms).]]></description>
